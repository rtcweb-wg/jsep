      <t>This document describes the mechanisms for allowing a Javascript
      application to control the signaling plane of a multimedia session via
      the interface specified in the W3C RTCPeerConnection API, and discusses
      how this relates to existing signaling protocols.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes how the W3C WEBRTC RTCPeerConnection
      interface<xref target="W3C.WD-webrtc-20111027"></xref> is used to
      control the setup, management and teardown of a multimedia session.</t>

      <section title="General Design of JSEP">
        <t>The thinking behind WebRTC call setup has been to fully specify and
        control the media plane, but to leave the signaling plane up to the
        application as much as possible. The rationale is that different
        applications may prefer to use different protocols, such as the
        existing SIP or Jingle call signaling protocols, or something custom
        to the particular application, perhaps for a novel use case. In this
        approach, the key information that needs to be exchanged is the
        multimedia session description, which specifies the necessary
        transport and media configuration information necessary to establish
        the media plane.</t>

        <t>The browser environment also has its own challenges that pose
        problems for an embedded signaling state machine. One of these is that
        the user may reload the web page at any time. If the browser is fully
        in charge of the signaling state, this will result in the loss of the
        call when this state is wiped by the reload. However, if the state can
        be stored at the server, and pushed back down to the new page, the
        call can be resumed with minimal interruption.</t>

        <t>With these considerations in mind, this document describes the
        Javascript Session Establishment Protocol (JSEP) that allows for full
        control of the signaling state machine from Javascript. This mechanism
        effectively removes the browser almost completely from the core
        signaling flow; the only interface needed is a way for the application
        to pass in the local and remote session descriptions negotiated by
        whatever signaling mechanism is used, and a way to interact with the
        ICE state machine.</t>

        <t>In this document, the use of JSEP is described as if it always
        occurs between two browsers. Note though in many cases it will
        actually be between a browser and some kind of server, such as a
        gateway or MCU. This distinction is invisible to the browser; it just
        follows the instructions it is given via the API.</t>

        <t>JSEP's handling of session descriptions is simple and
        straightforward. Whenever an offer/answer exchange is needed, the
        initiating side creates an offer by calling a createOffer() API. The
        application optionally modifies that offer, and then uses it to set up
        its local config via the setLocalDescription() API. The offer is then
        sent off to the remote side over its preferred signaling mechanism
        (e.g., WebSockets); upon receipt of that offer, the remote party
        installs it using the setRemoteDescription() API.</t>

        <t>When the call is accepted, the callee uses the createAnswer() API
        to generate an appropriate answer, applies it using
        setLocalDescription(), and sends the answer back to the initiator over
        the signaling channel. When the offerer gets that answer, it installs
        it using setRemoteDescription(), and initial setup is complete. This
        process can be repeated for additional offer/answer exchanges.</t>

        <t>Regarding ICE <xref target="RFC5245"></xref>, JSEP decouples the
        ICE state machine from the overall signaling state machine, as the ICE
        state machine must remain in the browser, because only the browser has
        the necessary knowledge of candidates and other transport info.
        Performing this separation also provides additional flexibility; in
        protocols that decouple session descriptions from transport, such as
        Jingle, the transport information can be sent separately; in protocols
        that don't, such as SIP, the information can be used in the aggregated
        form. Sending transport information separately can allow for faster
        ICE and DTLS startup, since the necessary roundtrips can occur while
        waiting for the remote side to accept the session.</t>

        <t>Through its abstraction of signaling, the JSEP approach does
        require the application to be aware of the signaling process. While
        the application does not need to understand the contents of session
        descriptions to set up a call, the application must call the right
        APIs at the right times, convert the session descriptions and ICE
        information into the defined messages of its chosen signaling
        protocol, and perform the reverse conversion on the messages it
        receives from the other side.</t>

        <t>One way to mitigate this is to provide a Javascript library that
        hides this complexity from the developer; said library would implement
        a given signaling protocol along with its state machine and
        serialization code, presenting a higher level call-oriented interface
        to the application developer. For example, this library could easily
        adapt the JSEP API into the API that was proposed for the ROAP
        signaling protocol <xref
        target="I-D.jennings-rtcweb-signaling"></xref>, which would perform a
        ROAP call setup under the covers, interacting with the application
        only when it needs a signaling message to be sent. In the same
        fashion, one could also implement other popular signaling protocols,
        including SIP or Jingle. This allow JSEP to provide greater control
        for the experienced developer without forcing any additional
        complexity on the novice developer.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Other Approaches Considered">
        <t>One approach that was considered instead of JSEP was to include a
        lightweight signaling protocol. Instead of providing session
        descriptions to the API, the API would produce and consume messages
        from this protocol. While providing a more high-level API, this put
        more control of signaling within the browser, forcing the browser to
        have to understand and handle concepts like signaling glare. In
        addition, it prevented the application from driving the state machine
        to a desired state, as is needed in the page reload case.</t>

        <t>A second approach that was considered but not chosen was to
        decouple the management of the media control objects from session
        descriptions, instead offering APIs that would control each component
        directly. This was rejected based on a feeling that requiring exposure
        of this level of complexity to the application programmer would not be
        beneficial; it would result in an API where even a simple example
        would require a significant amount of code to orchestrate all the
        needed interactions, as well as creating a large API surface that
        needed to be agreed upon and documented. In addition, these API points
        could be called in any order, resulting in a more complex set of
        interactions with the media subsystem than the JSEP approach, which
        specifies how session descriptions are to be evaluated and
        applied.</t>

        <t>One variation on JSEP that was considered was to keep the basic
        session description-oriented API, but to move the mechanism for
        generating offers and answers out of the browser. Instead of providing
        createOffer/createAnswer methods within the browser, this approach
        would instead expose a getCapabilities API which would provide the
        application with the information it needed in order to generate its
        own session descriptions. This increases the amount of work that the
        application needs to do; it needs to know how to generate session
        descriptions from capabilities, and especially how to generate the
        correct answer from an arbitrary offer and the supported capabilities.
        While this could certainly be addressed by using a library like the
        one mentioned above, it basically forces the use of said library even
        for a simple example. Providing createOffer/createAnswer avoids this
        problem, but still allows applications to generate their own
        offers/answers (to a large extent) if they choose, using the
        description generated by createOffer as an indication of the browser's
        capabilities.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Semantics and Syntax">
      <section title="Signaling Model">
        <t>JSEP does not specify a particular signaling model or state
        machine, other than the generic need to exchange SDP media
        descriptions in the fashion described by <xref
        target="RFC3264"></xref> (offer/answer) in order for both sides of the
        session to know how to conduct the session. JSEP provides mechanisms
        to create offers and answers, as well as to apply them to a session.
        However, the browser is totally decoupled from the actual mechanism by
        which these offers and answers are communicated to the remote side,
        including addressing, retransmission, forking, and glare handling.
        These issues are left entirely up to the application; the application
        has complete control over which offers and answers get handed to the
        browser, and when.</t>

      <section title="Session Descriptions and State Machine">
        <t>In order to establish the media plane, the user agent needs
        specific parameters to indicate what to transmit to the remote side,
        as well as how to handle the media that is received. These parameters
        are determined by the exchange of session descriptions in offers and
        answers, and there are certain details to this process that must be
        handled in the JSEP APIs.</t>

        <t>Whether a session description applies to the local side or the
        remote side affects the meaning of that description. For example, the
        list of codecs sent to a remote party indicates what the local side is
        willing to receive, which, when intersected with the set of codecs the
        remote side supports, specifies what the remote side should send.
        However, not all parameters follow this rule; for example, the SRTP
        parameters <xref target="RFC4568"></xref> sent to a remote party
        indicate what the local side will use to encrypt, and thereby what the
        remote party should expect to receive; the remote party will have to
        accept these parameters, with no option to choose a different
        value.</t>

        <t>In addition, various RFCs put different conditions on the format of
        offers versus answers. For example, a offer may propose multiple SRTP
        configurations, but an answer may only contain a single SRTP
        configuration.</t>

        <t>Lastly, while the exact media parameters are only known only after
        a offer and an answer have been exchanged, it is possible for the
        offerer to receive media after they have sent an offer and before they
        have received an answer. To properly process incoming media in this
        case, the offerer's media handler must be aware of the details of the
        offer before the answer arrives.</t>

        <t>Therefore, in order to handle session descriptions properly, the
        user agent needs: <list style="numbers">
            <t>To know if a session description pertains to the local or
            remote side.</t>

            <t>To know if a session description is an offer or an answer.</t>

            <t>To allow the offer to be specified independently of the
            answer.</t>
          </list> JSEP addresses this by adding both a setLocalDescription and
        a setRemoteDescription method and having session description objects
        contain a type field indicating the type of session description being
        supplied. This satisfies the requirements listed above for both the
        offerer, who first calls setLocalDescription(sdp [offer]) and then
        later setRemoteDescription(sdp [answer]), as well as for the answerer,
        who first calls setRemoteDescription(sdp [offer]) and then later
        setLocalDescription(sdp [answer]).</t>

        <t>JSEP also allows for an answer to be treated as provisional by the
        application. Provisional answers provide a way for an answerer to
        communicate initial session parameters back to the offerer, in order
        to allow the session to begin, while allowing a final answer to be
        specified later. This concept of a final answer is important to the
        offer/answer model; when such an answer is received, any extra
        resources allocated by the caller can be released, now that the exact
        session configuration is known. These "resources" can include things
        like extra ICE components, TURN candidates, or video decoders.
        Provisional answers, on the other hand, do no such deallocation
        results; as a result, multiple dissimilar provisional answers can be
        received and applied during call setup.</t>

        <t>In <xref target="RFC3264"></xref>, the constraint at the signaling
        level is that only one offer can be outstanding for a given session,
        but from the media stack level, a new offer can be generated at any
        point. For example, when using SIP for signaling, if one offer is
        sent, then cancelled using a SIP CANCEL, another offer can be
        generated even though no answer was received for the first offer. To
        support this, the JSEP media layer can provide an offer whenever the
        Javascript application needs one for the signaling. The answerer can
        send back zero or more provisional answers, and finally end the
        offer-answer exchange by sending a final answer. The state machine for
        this is as follows:</t>

      <section title="Session Description Format">
        <t>In the WebRTC specification, session descriptions are formatted as
        SDP messages. While this format is not optimal for manipulation from
        Javascript, it is widely accepted, and frequently updated with new
        features. Any alternate encoding of session descriptions would have to
        keep pace with the changes to SDP, at least until the time that this
        new encoding eclipsed SDP in popularity. As a result, JSEP currently
        uses SDP as the internal representation for its session
        descriptions.</t>

        <t>However, to simplify Javascript processing, and provide for future
        flexibility, the SDP syntax is encapsulated within a
        SessionDescription object, which can be constructed from SDP, and be
        serialized out to SDP. If future specifications agree on a JSON format
        for session descriptions, we could easily enable this object to
        generate and consume that JSON.</t>

        <t>Other methods may be added to SessionDescription in the future to
        simplify handling of SessionDescriptions from Javascript. In the
        meantime, Javascript libraries can be used to perform these
        manipulations.</t>

        <t>Note that most applications should be able to treat the
        SessionDescriptions produced and consumed by these various API calls
        as opaque blobs; that is, the application will not need to read or
        change them. The W3C API will provide appropriate APIs to allow the
        application to control various session parameters, which will provide
        the necessary information to the browser about what sort of
        SessionDescription to produce.</t>

      <section title="ICE">

        <t> The browser keeps a pool of potential ICE candidates available to
        help ensure rapid media setup. The size of this pool is fairly small and
        controlled by an API from the Javascript application. When the browser
        needs an new ICE candiate, it can start by seeing if any are available
        in the pool and if there are candidates in the pool, use them. There are
        times when there will not be enough candidates in the pool, either
        because a large number of candidates is needed, or because the pool has
        not had enough time to gather candidates. In these cases the trickle ICE
        mechanism allows a browser to create and offer or answer before without
        waiting for the time it would take to gather all the ICE candidates
        required if trickle ICE is not used.
        </t>

        <t>When a new ICE candidate is available, the ICE Agent will notify
        the application via a callback; these candidates will automatically be
        added to the local session description. When all candidates have been
        gathered, the callback will also be invoked to signal that the
        gathering process is complete.</t>

        <section title="ICE Candidate Trickling">
          <t>Candidate trickling is a technique through which a caller may
          incrementally provide candidates to the callee after the initial
          offer has been dispatched; the semantics of "Trickle ICE" are
          defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"></xref>. This
          process allows the callee to begin acting upon the call and setting
          up the ICE (and perhaps DTLS) connections immediately, without
          having to wait for the caller to gather all possible candidates.
          This results in faster call startup in cases where gathering is not
          performed prior to initiating the call.</t>

          <t>JSEP supports optional candidate trickling by providing APIs that
          provide control and feedback on the ICE candidate gathering process.
          Applications that support candidate trickling can send the initial
          offer immediately and send individual candidates when they get the
          notified of a new candidate; applications that do not support this
          feature can simply wait for the indication that gathering is
          complete, and then create and send their offer, with all the
          candidates, at this time.</t>

          <t>Upon receipt of trickled candidates, the receiving application
          will supply them to its ICE Agent. This triggers the ICE Agent to
          start using the new remote candidates for connectivity checks.</t>

          <section title="ICE Candidate Format">
            <t>As with session descriptions, the syntax of the IceCandidate
            object provides some abstraction, but can be easily converted to
            and from the SDP candidate lines.</t>

            <t>The candidate lines are the only SDP information that is
            contained within IceCandidate, as they represent the only
            information needed that is not present in the initial offer (i.e.
            for trickle candidates). This information is carried with the same
            syntax as the "candidate-attribute" field defined for ICE. For
            example:</t>

            <figure>
              <artwork><![CDATA[
candidate:1 1 UDP 1694498815 192.0.2.33 10000 typ host
]]></artwork>
            </figure>

            <t>The IceCandidate object also contains fields to indicate which
            m= line it should be associated with. The m line can be identified
            in one of two ways; either by a m-line index, or a MID. The m-line
            index is a zero-based index, referring to the Nth m-line in the
            SDP. The MID uses the "media stream identification", as defined in
            <xref target="RFC5888"></xref> , to identify the m-line. WebRTC
            implementations creating an ICE Candidate object MUST populate
            both of these fields. Implementations receiving an ICE Candidate
            object SHOULD use the MID if they implement that functionality, or
            the m-line index, if not.</t>

      <section title="Interactions With Forking">
        <t>Some call signaling systems allow various types of forking where an
        SDP Offer may be provided to more than one device. For example, SIP
        <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> defines both a "Parallel Search" and
        "Sequential Search". Although these are primarily signaling level
        issues that are outside the scope of JSEP, they do have some impact on
        the configuration of the media plane which is relevant. When forking
        happens at the signaling layer, the Javascript application responsible
        for the signaling needs to make the decisions about what media should
        be sent or received at any point of time, as well as which remote
        endpoint it should communicate with; JSEP is used to make sure the
        media engine can make the RTP and media perform as required by the
        application. The basic operations that the applications can have the
        media engine do are: <list>
            <t>Start exchanging media to a given remote peer, but keep all the
            resources reserved in the offer.</t>

            <t>Start exchanging media with a given remote peer, and free any
            resources in the offer that are not being used.</t>
          </list></t>

        <section title="Sequential Forking">
          <t>Sequential forking involves a call being dispatched to multiple
          remote callees, where each callee can accept the call, but only one
          active session ever exists at a time; no mixing of received media is
          performed.</t>

          <t>JSEP handles sequential forking well, allowing the application to
          easily control the policy for selecting the desired remote endpoint.
          When an answer arrives from one of the callees, the application can
          choose to apply it either as a provisional answer, leaving open the
          possibility of using a different answer in the future, or apply it
          as a final answer, ending the setup flow.</t>

          <t>In a "first-one-wins" situation, the first answer will be applied
          as a final answer, and the application will reject any subsequent
          answers. In SIP parlance, this would be ACK + BYE.</t>

          <t>In a "last-one-wins" situation, all answers would be applied as
          provisional answers, and any previous call leg will be terminated.
          At some point, the application will end the setup process, perhaps
          with a timer; at this point, the application could reapply the
          existing remote description as a final answer.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Parallel Forking">
          <t>Parallel forking involves a call being dispatched to multiple
          remote callees, where each callee can accept the call, and multiple
          simultaneous active signaling sessions can be established as a
          result. If multiple callees send media at the same time, the
          possibilities for handling this are described in Section 3.1 of
          <xref target="RFC3960"></xref>. Most SIP devices today only support
          exchanging media with a single device at a time, and do not try to
          mix multiple early media audio sources, as that could result in a
          confusing situation. For example, consider having a European
          ringback tone mixed together with the North American ringback tone -
          the resulting sound would not be like either tone, and would confuse
          the user. If the signaling application wishes to only exchange media
          with one of the remote endpoints at a time, then from a media engine
          point of view, this is exactly like the sequential forking case.</t>

          <t>In the parallel forking case where the Javascript application
          wishes to simultaneously exchange media with multiple peers, the
          flow is slightly more complex, but the Javascript application can
          follow the strategy that <xref target="RFC3960"></xref> describes
          using UPDATE. (It is worth noting that use cases where this is the
          desired behavior are very unusual.) The UPDATE approach allows the
          signaling to set up a separate media flow for each peer that it
          wishes to exchange media with. In JSEP, this offer used in the
          UPDATE would be formed by simply creating a new PeerConnection and
          making sure that the same local media streams have been added into
          this new PeerConnection. Then the new PeerConnection object would
          produce a SDP offer that could be used by the signaling to perform
          the UPDATE strategy discussed in <xref target="RFC3960"></xref>.</t>

          <t>As a result of sharing the media streams, the application will
          end up with N parallel PeerConnection sessions, each with a local
          and remote description and their own local and remote addresses. The
          media flow from these sessions can be managed by specifying SDP
          direction attributes in the descriptions, or the application can
          choose to play out the media from all sessions mixed together. Of
          course, if the application wants to only keep a single session, it
          can simply terminate the sessions that it no longer needs.</t>

      <section title="Session Rehydration">
        <t>In the event that the local application state is reinitialized,
        either due to a user reload of the page, or a decision within the
        application to reload itself (perhaps to update to a new version), it
        is possible to keep an existing session alive, via a process called
        "rehydration". The explicit goal of rehydration is to carry out this
        session resumption with no interaction with the remote side other than
        normal call signaling messages.</t>

        <t>With rehydration, the current signaling state is persisted
        somewhere outside of the page, perhaps on the application server, or
        in browser local storage. The page is then reloaded, the saved
        signaling state is retrieved, and a new PeerConnection object is
        created for the session. The previously obtained MediaStreams are
        re-acquired, and are given the same IDs as the original session; this
        ensures the IDs in use by the remote side continue to work. Next, a
        new offer is generated by the new PeerConnection; this offer will have
        new ICE and possibly new DTLS-SRTP certificate fingerprints (since the
        old ICE and SRTP state has been lost). Finally, this offer is used to
        re-initiate the session with the existing remote endpoint, who simply
        sees the new offer as an in-call renegotiation, and replies with an
        answer that can be supplied to setRemoteDescription. ICE processing
        proceeds as usual, and as soon as connectivity is established, the
        session will be back up and running again.</t>

        <t>[OPEN ISSUE: EKR proposed an alternative rehydration approach where
        the actual internal PeerConnection object in the browser was kept
        alive for some time after the web page was killed and provided some
        way for a new page to acquire the old PeerConnection object.]</t>

    <section title="Interface">
      <t>This section details the basic operations that must be present to
      implement JSEP functionality. The actual API exposed in the W3C API may
      have somewhat different syntax, but should map easily to these
      concepts.</t>

      <section title="Methods">
        <section title="createOffer">
          <t>The createOffer method generates a blob of SDP that contains a
          <xref target="RFC3264"></xref> offer with the supported
          configurations for the session, including descriptions of the local
          MediaStreams attached to this PeerConnection, the codec/RTP/RTCP
          options supported by this implementation, and any candidates that
          have been gathered by the ICE Agent. A constraints parameters may be
          supplied to provide additional control over the generated offer.
          This constraints parameter should allow for the following
          manipulations to be performed: <list style="symbols">
              <t>To indicate support for a media type even if no
              MediaStreamTracks of that type have been added to the session
              (e.g., an audio call that wants to receive video.)</t>

              <t>To trigger an ICE restart, for the purpose of reestablishing
              connectivity.</t>

              <t>For re-offer cases, to request an offer that contains the
              full set of supported capabilities, as opposed to just the
              currently negotiated parameters.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>In the initial offer, the generated SDP will contain all desired
          functionality for the session (certain parts that are supported but
          not desired by default may be omitted); for each SDP line, the
          generation of the SDP will follow the process defined for generating
          an initial offer from the document that specifies the given SDP
          line. The exact handling of initial offer generation is detailed in
          Section 5.2.1. below.</t>

          <t>In the event createOffer is called after the session is
          established, createOffer will generate an offer to modify the
          current session based on any changes that have been made to the
          session, e.g. adding or removing MediaStreams, or requesting an ICE
          restart. For each existing stream, the generation of each SDP line
          must follow the process defined for generating an updated offer from
          the document that specifies the given SDP line. For each new stream,
          the generation of the SDP must follow the process of generating an
          initial offer, as mentioned above. If no changes have been made, or
          for SDP lines that are unaffected by the requested changes, the
          offer will only contain the parameters negotiated by the last
          offer-answer exchange. The exact handling of subsequent offer
          generation is detailed in Section 5.2.2. below.</t>

          <t>Session descriptions generated by createOffer must be immediately
          usable by setLocalDescription; if a system has limited resources
          (e.g. a finite number of decoders), createOffer should return an
          offer that reflects the current state of the system, so that
          setLocalDescription will succeed when it attempts to acquire those
          resources. Because this method may need to inspect the system state
          to determine the currently available resources, it may be
          implemented as an async operation.</t>

          <t>Calling this method may do things such as generate new ICE
          credentials, but does not result in candidate gathering, or cause
          media to start or stop flowing.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="createAnswer">
          <t>The createAnswer method generates a blob of SDP that contains a
          <xref target="RFC3264"></xref> SDP answer with the supported
          configuration for the session that is compatible with the parameters
          supplied in the offer. Like createOffer, the returned blob contains
          descriptions of the local MediaStreams attached to this
          PeerConnection, the codec/RTP/RTCP options negotiated for this
          session, and any candidates that have been gathered by the ICE
          Agent. A constraints parameter may be supplied to provide additional
          control over the generated answer.</t>

          <t>As an answer, the generated SDP will contain a specific
          configuration that specifies how the media plane should be
          established; for each SDP line, the generation of the SDP must
          follow the process defined for generating an answer from the
          document that specifies the given SDP line. The exact handling of
          answer generation is detailed in Section 5.3. below.</t>

          <t>Session descriptions generated by createAnswer must be
          immediately usable by setLocalDescription; like createOffer, the
          returned description should reflect the current state of the system.
          Because this method may need to inspect the system state to
          determine the currently available resources, it may need to be
          implemented as an async operation.</t>

          <t>Calling this method may do things such as generate new ICE
          credentials, but does not trigger candidate gathering or change
          media state.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="SessionDescriptionType">
          <t>Session description objects (RTCSessionDescription) may be of
          type "offer", "pranswer", and "answer". These types provide
          information as to how the description parameter should be parsed,
          and how the media state should be changed.</t>

          <t>"offer" indicates that a description should be parsed as an
          offer; said description may include many possible media
          configurations. A description used as an "offer" may be applied
          anytime the PeerConnection is in a stable state, or as an update to
          a previously supplied but unanswered "offer".</t>

          <t>"pranswer" indicates that a description should be parsed as an
          answer, but not a final answer, and so should not result in the
          freeing of allocated resources. It may result in the start of media
          transmission, if the answer does not specify an inactive media
          direction. A description used as a "pranswer" may be applied as a
          response to an "offer", or an update to a previously sent
          "pranswer".</t>

          <t>"answer" indicates that a description should be parsed as an
          answer, the offer-answer exchange should be considered complete, and
          any resources (decoders, candidates) that are no longer needed can
          be released. A description used as an "answer" may be applied as a
          response to a "offer", or an update to a previously sent
          "pranswer".</t>

          <t>The only difference between a provisional and final answer is
          that the final answer results in the freeing of any unused resources
          that were allocated as a result of the offer. As such, the
          application can use some discretion on whether an answer should be
          applied as provisional or final, and can change the type of the
          session description as needed. For example, in a serial forking
          scenario, an application may receive multiple "final" answers, one
          from each remote endpoint. The application could choose to accept
          the initial answers as provisional answers, and only apply an answer
          as final when it receives one that meets its criteria (e.g. a live
          user instead of voicemail).</t>

          <section title="Use of Provisional Answers">
            <t>Most web applications will not need to create answers using the
            "pranswer" type. While it is good practice to send an immediate 
            response to an "offer", in order to warm up the session transport
            and prevent media clipping, the preferred handling for a web
            application would be to create and send an "inactive" final answer
            immediately after receiving the offer. Later, when the called 
            user actually accepts the call, the application can create a new 
            "sendrecv" offer to update the previous offer/answer pair and start
            the media flow. While this could also be done with an inactive
            "pranswer", followed by a sendrecv "answer", the initial "pranswer"
            leaves the offer-answer exchange open, which means the caller cannot
            send an updated offer during this time.</t>

            <t>As an example, consider a typical web application that will
            set up a data channel, an audio channel, and a video channel. When
            an endpoint receives an offer with these channels, it could send an
            answer accepting the data channel for two-way data, and accepting 
            the audio and video tracks as inactive or receive-only. It could
            then ask the user to accept the call, acquire the local media
            streams, and send a new offer to the remote side moving the audio
            and video to be two-way media. By the time the human has accepted
            the call and triggered the new offer, it is likely that the ICE and
            DTLS handshaking for all the channels will already be set up.</t>

            <t>Of course, some applications may not be able to perform this
            double offer-answer exchange, particularly ones that are attempting
            to gateway to legacy signaling protocols. In these cases, "pranswer"
            can still provide the application with a mechanism to warm up the
            transport.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Rollback">
            <t>In certain situations it may be desirable to "undo" a change
            made to setLocalDescription or setRemoteDescription. Consider a
            case where a call is ongoing, and one side wants to change some of
            the session parameters; that side generates an updated offer and
            then calls setLocalDescription. However, the remote side, either
            before or after setRemoteDescription, decides it does not want to
            accept the new parameters, and sends a reject message back to the
            offerer. Now, the offerer, and possibly the answerer as well, need
            to return to a stable state and the previous local/remote
            description. To support this, we introduce the concept of
            "rollback".</t>

            <t>A rollback returns the state machine to its previous state, and
            the local or remote description to its previous value. Any
            resources or candidates that were allocated by the new local
            description are discarded; any media that is received will be
            processed according to the previous session description.</t>

            <t>A rollback is performed by supplying a session description of
            type "rollback" to either setLocalDescription or
            setRemoteDescription, depending on which needs to be rolled back
            (i.e. if the new offer was supplied to setLocalDescription, the
            rollback should be done on setLocalDescription as well.)</t>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section title="setLocalDescription">
          <t>The setLocalDescription method instructs the PeerConnection to
          apply the supplied SDP blob as its local configuration. The type
          field indicates whether the blob should be processed as an offer,
          provisional answer, or final answer; offers and answers are checked
          differently, using the various rules that exist for each SDP
          line.</t>

          <t>This API changes the local media state; among other things, it
          sets up local resources for receiving and decoding media. In order
          to successfully handle scenarios where the application wants to
          offer to change from one media format to a different, incompatible
          format, the PeerConnection must be able to simultaneously support
          use of both the old and new local descriptions (e.g. support codecs
          that exist in both descriptions) until a final answer is received,
          at which point the PeerConnection can fully adopt the new local
          description, or roll back to the old description if the remote side
          denied the change.</t>

          <t>This API indirectly controls the candidate gathering process.
          When a local description is supplied, and the number of transports
          currently in use does not match the number of transports needed by
          the local description, the PeerConnection will create transports as
          needed and begin gathering candidates for them.</t>

          <t>If setRemoteDescription was previous called with an offer, and
          setLocalDescription is called with an answer (provisional or final),
          and the media directions are compatible, and media are available to

      <section anchor="sec-create-offer" title="Constructing an Offer">
        <t>When createOffer is called, a new SDP description must be created
        that includes the functionality specified in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage"></xref>. The exact details of this
        process are explained below.</t>

        <section title="Initial Offers">
          <t>When createOffer is called for the first time, the result is
          known as the initial offer.</t>

          <t>The first step in generating an initial offer is to generate
          session-level attributes, as specified in <xref
          target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 5. Specifically: <list
              style="symbols">
              <t>The first SDP line MUST be "v=0", as specified in <xref
              target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 5.1</t>

              <t>The second SDP line MUST be an "o=" line, as specified in
              <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 5.2. The value of the
              &lt;username&gt; field SHOULD be "-". The value of the
              &lt;sess-id&gt; field SHOULD be a cryptographically random
              number. To ensure uniqueness, this number SHOULD be at least 64
              bits long. The value of the &lt;sess-version&gt; field SHOULD be
              zero. The value of the &lt;nettype&gt; &lt;addrtype&gt;
              &lt;unicast-address&gt; tuple SHOULD be set to a non-meaningful
              address, such as IN IP4 0.0.0.0, to prevent leaking the local
              address in this field. As mentioned in <xref
              target="RFC4566"></xref>, the entire o= line needs to be unique,
              but selecting a random number for &lt;sess-id&gt; is sufficient
              to accomplish this.</t>

              <t>The third SDP line MUST be a "s=" line, as specified in <xref
              target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 5.3; to match the "o=" line, a
              single dash SHOULD be used as the session name, e.g. "s=-".</t>

              <t>Session Information ("i="), URI ("u="), Email Address ("e="),
              Phone Number ("p="), Bandwidth ("b="), Repeat Times ("r="), and
              Time Zones ("z=") lines are not useful in this context and
              SHOULD NOT be included.</t>

              <t>Encryption Keys ("k=") lines do not provide sufficient
              security and MUST NOT be included.</t>

              <t>A "t=" line MUST be added, as specified in <xref
              target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 5.9; both &lt;start-time&gt;
              and &lt;stop-time&gt; SHOULD be set to zero, e.g. "t=0 0".</t>

              <t>An "a=msid-semantic:WMS" line MUST be added, as specified in
              <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-msid"></xref>, Section 4.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The next step is to generate m= sections for each
          MediaStreamTrack that has been added to the PeerConnection via the
          addStream method. (Note that this method takes a MediaStream, which
          can contain multiple MediaStreamTracks, and therefore multiple m=
          sections can be generated even if addStream is only called once.) 
          When generating m= sections, the ordering is based on (1) the order
          in which the MediaStreams were added to the PeerConnection, and (2)
          the alphabetical ordering of the media type for the MediaStreamTrack.
          For example, if a MediaStream containing both an audio and a video 
          MediaStreamTrack is added to a PeerConnection, the resultant m=audio
          section will precede the m=video section.</t>

          <t>Each m= section, provided it is not being bundled into
          another m= section, MUST generate a unique set of ICE credentials
          and gather its own unique set of ICE candidates. Otherwise, it MUST
          use the same ICE credentials and candidates that were used in the
          m= section that it is being bundled into.</t>

          <t>For DTLS, all m= sections MUST use the certificate for the
          identity that has been specified for the PeerConnection; as a result,
          they MUST all have the same <xref target="RFC4572"></xref>fingerprint
          value.</t>

          <t>Each m= section should be generated as specified in <xref
          target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 5.14. For the m= line itself, the
          following rules MUST be followed:<list style="symbols">
            <t>The port value is set to the port of the default ICE candidate 
            for this m= section; if this m= section is not being bundled into
            another m= section, the port value MUST be unique. If no candidates
            have yet been gathered, and a 'null' port value is being used, as 
            indicated in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"></xref>,
            Section 5.1., this port MUST still be unique.</t>
            <t>To properly indicate use of DTLS, the &lt;proto&gt; field MUST
            be set to "UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF", as specified in 
            <xref target="RFC5764"/>, Section 8.</t>

        <t>When createAnswer is called, a new SDP description must be created
        that is compatible with the supplied remote description as well as the
        requirements specified in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage"></xref>. The exact details of this
        process are explained below.</t>

        <section title="Initial Answers">
          <t>When createAnswer is called for the first time after a remote
          description has been provided, the result is known as the initial
          answer. If no remote description has been installed, an answer
          cannot be generated, and an error MUST be returned.</t>

          <t>Note that the remote description SDP may not have been created by
          a JSEP endpoint and may not conform to all the requirements listed
          in <xref target="sec-create-offer"></xref>. For many cases, this is
          not a problem. However, if any mandatory SDP attributes are missing,
          or functionality listed as mandatory-to-use above is not present, 
          this MUST be treated as an error, and MUST cause the affected 
          m= sections to be marked as rejected.</t>

          <t>The first step in generating an initial answer is to generate
          session-level attributes. The process here is identical to that
          indicated in the Initial Offers section above.</t>

          <t>The next step is to generate m= sections for each m= section that
          is present in the remote offer, as specified in <xref
          target="RFC3264"></xref>, Section 6. For the purposes of this
          discussion, any session-level attributes in the offer that are also
          valid as media-level attributes SHALL be considered to be present in
          each m= section.</t>

          <t>If any of the offered m= sections have been rejected, by stopping
          the associated remote MediaStreamTrack, the corresponding m= section
          in the answer MUST be marked as rejected by setting the port in the
          m= line to zero, as indicated in <xref target="RFC3264"></xref>,
          Section 6., and processing continues with the next m= section.</t>

          <t>For each non-rejected m= section of a given media type, if there
          is a local MediaStreamTrack of the specified type which has been
          added to the PeerConnection via addStream and not yet associated
          with a m= section, the MediaStreamTrack is associated with the m=
          section at this time. If there are more m= sections of a certain
          type than MediaStreamTracks, some m= sections will not have an
          associated MediaStreamTrack. If there are more MediaStreamTracks of
          a certain type than m= sections, only the first N MediaStreamTracks
          will be able to be associated in the constructed answer. The
          remainder will need to be associated in a subsequent offer.</t>

          <t>Each m= section should then generated as specified in <xref
          target="RFC3264"></xref>, Section 6.1. Because use of DTLS is
          mandatory, the &lt;proto&gt; field MUST be set to "UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF".
          If the offer supports BUNDLE, all m= sections to be BUNDLEd must use
          the same ICE credentials and candidates; all m= sections not being

      <t>The following elements of the SDP media description MUST NOT be

      <t>The following parameters may be controlled by constraints passed into
      createOffer/createAnswer. As an open issue, these changes may also be be
      performed by manipulating the SDP returned from
      createOffer/createAnswer, as indicated above, as long as the

      <t>For example, an application could implement call hold by adding an
      a=inactive attribute to its local description, and then applying and
      signaling that description.</t>

      <t>The application can also modify the SDP to reduce the capabilities in
      the offer it sends to the far side in any way the application sees fit,
      as long as it is a valid SDP offer and specifies a subset of what the
      browser is expecting to do.</t>

      <t>As always, the application is solely responsible for what it sends to
      the other party, and all incoming SDP will be processed by the browser
      to the extent of its capabilities. It is an error to assume that all SDP
      is well-formed; however, one should be able to assume that any
      implementation of this specification will be able to process, as a
      remote offer or answer, unmodified SDP coming from any other
      implementation of this specification.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>Real-time media streams that use RTP are, to some degree,
            resilient against packet losses. Receivers may use the base
            mechanisms of the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) to
            report packet reception statistics and thus allow a sender to
            adapt its transmission behavior in the mid-term. This is the sole
            means for feedback and feedback-based error repair (besides a few
            codec-specific mechanisms). This document defines an extension to
            the Audio-visual Profile (AVP) that enables receivers to provide,
            statistically, more immediate feedback to the senders and thus
            allows for short-term adaptation and efficient feedback-based
            repair mechanisms to be implemented. This early feedback profile
            (AVPF) maintains the AVP bandwidth constraints for RTCP and
            preserves scalability to large groups. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) provides mechanisms to
            describe attributes of multimedia sessions and of individual media
            streams (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions) within
            a multimedia session. In the RTCWeb WG, there is a need to use a
            single 5-tuple for sending and receiving media associated with
            multiple media descriptions ("m=" lines). Such a requirement has
            raised concerns over the semantic implications of the SDP
            attributes associated with the RTP Sessions multiplexed over a

            streams (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions) within

            technique for real-time applications with relaxed delay bounds.
            This document describes an RTP payload format for performing
            retransmissions. Retransmitted RTP packets are sent in a separate
            stream from the original RTP stream. It is assumed that feedback
            from receivers to senders is available. In particular, it is
            assumed that Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) feedback
            as defined in the extended RTP profile for RTCP-based feedback
            (denoted RTP/AVPF) is available in this memo.

            <t>This document describes an extension to the Interactive
            Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol that allows ICE agents
            to send and receive candidates incrementally rather than
            exchanging complete lists. With such incremental provisioning, ICE
            agents can begin connectivity checks while they are still
            gathering candidates and considerably shorten the time necessary
            for ICE processing to complete. The above mechanism is also
            referred to as "trickle ICE".</t>

            <t>This document describes an protocol used to negotiate media
            between browsers or other compatible devices. This protocol
            provides the state machinery needed to implement the offer/answer
            model (RFC 3264), and defines the semantics and necessary
            attributes of messages that must be exchanged. The protocol uses
            an abstract transport in that it does not actually define how
            these messages are exchanged. Rather, such exchanges are handled
            through web-based transports like HTTP or WebSockets. The protocol
            focuses solely on media negotiation and does not handle call
            control, call processing, or other functions.</t>

            <t>This document specifies how to use the Session Initiation
            Protocol (SIP) to establish a Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
            (SRTP) security context using the Datagram Transport Layer
            Security (DTLS) protocol. It describes a mechanism of transporting
            a fingerprint attribute in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
            that identifies the key that will be presented during the DTLS
            handshake. The key exchange travels along the media path as
            opposed to the signaling path. The SIP Identity mechanism can be
            used to protect the integrity of the fingerprint attribute from
            modification by intermediate proxies. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
