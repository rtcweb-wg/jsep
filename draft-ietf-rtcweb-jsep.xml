      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This document describes how the W3C Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) RTCPeerConnection
      interface
      <xref target="W3C.webrtc" format="default"/> is used to control the setup,
      management, and teardown of a multimedia session.</t>
      <section anchor="sec.general-design-of-jsep" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>General Design of JSEP</name>
        <t>WebRTC call setup has been designed to focus on controlling
        the media plane, leaving signaling-plane behavior up to the
        application as much as possible. The rationale is that
        different applications may prefer to use different protocols,
        such as the existing SIP call signaling protocol, or something
        custom to the particular application, perhaps for a novel use
        case. In this approach, the key information that needs to be
        exchanged is the multimedia session description, which
        specifies the transport and media configuration
        information necessary to establish the media plane.</t>
        <t>With these considerations in mind, this document describes
        the JavaScript Session Establishment Protocol (JSEP), which
        allows for full control of the signaling state machine from
        JavaScript. As described above, JSEP assumes a model in which a
        JavaScript application executes inside a runtime containing
        WebRTC APIs (the "JSEP implementation"). The JSEP
        implementation is almost entirely divorced from the core
        signaling flow, which is instead handled by the JavaScript
        making use of two interfaces: (1) passing in local and remote
        session descriptions and (2) interacting with the Interactive
	Connectivity Establishment (ICE) state
        machine <xref target="RFC8445"/>. The combination of the JSEP implementation and the
        JavaScript application is referred to throughout this document
        as a "JSEP endpoint".</t>
        <t>In this document, the use of JSEP is described as if it
        always occurs between two JSEP endpoints. Note, though, that in many
        cases it will actually be between a JSEP endpoint and some kind
        of server, such as a gateway or Multipoint Control Unit (MCU). This distinction is
        invisible to the JSEP endpoint; it just follows the
        instructions it is given via the API.</t>
        <t>JSEP's handling of session descriptions is simple and
        straightforward. Whenever an offer/answer exchange is needed,
        the initiating side creates an offer by calling a createOffer()
        API. The application then uses that offer to set up its local
        config via the setLocalDescription() API. The offer is finally
        sent off to the remote side over its preferred signaling
        mechanism (e.g., WebSockets); upon receipt of that offer, the
        remote party installs it using the setRemoteDescription()
        API.</t>
        <t>To complete the offer/answer exchange, the remote party uses
        the createAnswer() API to generate an appropriate answer,
        applies it using the setLocalDescription() API, and sends the
        answer back to the initiator over the signaling channel. When
        the initiator gets that answer, it installs it using the
        setRemoteDescription() API, and initial setup is complete. This
        process can be repeated for additional offer/answer
        exchanges.</t>
        <t>Regarding ICE
        <xref target="RFC8445" format="default"/>, JSEP decouples the ICE state
        machine from the overall signaling state machine, as the ICE
        state machine must remain in the JSEP implementation, because
        only the implementation has the necessary knowledge of
        candidates and other transport information. Performing this
        separation provides additional flexibility in protocols that
        decouple session descriptions from transport. For instance, in
        traditional SIP, each offer or answer is self-contained,
        including both the session descriptions and the transport
        information. However,
        <xref target="RFC8840" format="default"/> allows SIP to
        be used with Trickle ICE
        <xref target="RFC8838" format="default"/>, in which the session
        description can be sent immediately and the transport
        information can be sent when available. Sending transport
        information separately can allow for faster ICE and DTLS
        startup, since ICE checks can start as soon as any transport
        information is available rather than waiting for all of it.
        JSEP's decoupling of the ICE and signaling state machines
        allows it to accommodate either model.</t>
        <t>Through its abstraction of signaling, the JSEP approach does
        require the application to be aware of the signaling process.
        While the application does not need to understand the contents
        of session descriptions to set up a call, the application must
        call the right APIs at the right times, convert the session
        descriptions and ICE information into the defined messages of
        its chosen signaling protocol, and perform the reverse
        conversion on the messages it receives from the other side.</t>
        <t>One way to make life easier for the application is to
        provide a JavaScript library that hides this complexity from
        the developer; said library would implement a given signaling
        protocol along with its state machine and serialization code,
        presenting a higher-level call-oriented interface to the
        application developer. For example, libraries exist to adapt
        the JSEP API into an API suitable for a SIP interface or an Extensible Messaging
	and Presence Protocol (XMPP) interface <xref target="RFC6120"/>.

<!-- [rfced] Section 1.1:  For ease of the reader, and per other
documents in this cluster (cluster C238), we expanded "XMPP," cited
RFC 6120, and added RFC 6120 to the list of Informative References.
Please let us know any concerns.

Original:
 For example,
 libraries exist to adapt the JSEP API into an API suitable for a SIP

Currently:
 For example,
 libraries exist to adapt the JSEP API into an API suitable for a SIP

            March 2011, <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6120>. -->

 Thus, JSEP
        provides greater control for the experienced developer without
        forcing any additional complexity on the novice developer.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec.other-approaches-consider" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Other Approaches Considered</name>
        <t>One approach that was considered instead of JSEP was to
        include a lightweight signaling protocol. Instead of providing
        session descriptions to the API, the API would produce and
        consume messages from this protocol. While providing a more
        high-level API, this put more control of signaling within the
        JSEP implementation, forcing it to have to understand and
        handle concepts like signaling glare (see
        <xref target="RFC3264" sectionFormat="comma" section="4"/>).</t>
        <t>A second approach that was considered but not chosen was to
        decouple the management of the media control objects from
        session descriptions, instead offering APIs that would control
        each component directly. This was rejected based on the
        argument that requiring exposure of this level of complexity to
        the application programmer would not be beneficial; it would
        result in an API where even a simple example would require a
        significant amount of code to orchestrate all the needed
        interactions, as well as creating a large API surface that
        needed to be agreed upon and documented.

<!-- [rfced] Section 1.2:  We had trouble parsing this sentence.
If the suggested text is not correct, please clarify "as well as
creating ..."

Original (the previous sentence is included for context):
 A second approach that was considered but not chosen was to decouple
 the management of the media control objects from session
 descriptions, instead offering APIs that would control each component
 directly.  This was rejected based on the argument that requiring
 exposure of this level of complexity to the application programmer
 would not be beneficial; it would result in an API where even a
 simple example would require a significant amount of code to
 orchestrate all the needed interactions, as well as creating a large
 API surface that needed to be agreed upon and documented.

Suggested:
 This was rejected based on the argument that requiring
 exposure of this level of complexity to the application programmer
 would not be beneficial; it would (1) result in an API where even a
 simple example would require a significant amount of code to
 orchestrate all the needed interactions and (2) create a large
 API surface that needed to be agreed upon and documented. -->

 In addition, these API
        points could be called in any order, resulting in a more
        complex set of interactions with the media subsystem than the
        JSEP approach, which specifies how session descriptions are to
        be evaluated and applied.</t>
        <t>One variation on JSEP that was considered was to keep the
        basic session-description-oriented API but to move the
        mechanism for generating offers and answers out of the JSEP
        implementation. Instead of providing createOffer/createAnswer
        methods within the implementation, this approach would instead
        expose a getCapabilities API, which would provide the
        application with the information it needed in order to generate
        its own session descriptions. This increases the amount of work
        that the application needs to do; it needs to know how to
        generate session descriptions from capabilities, and especially
        how to generate the correct answer from an arbitrary offer and
        the supported capabilities. While this could certainly be
        addressed by using a library like the one mentioned above, it
        basically forces the use of said library even for a simple
        example. Providing createOffer/createAnswer avoids this
        problem.</t>

        <name>Signaling Model</name>
        <t>JSEP does not specify a particular signaling model or state
        machine, other than the generic need to exchange session
        descriptions in the fashion described by
        <xref target="RFC3264" format="default"/> (offer/answer) in order for both
        sides of the session to know how to conduct the session. JSEP
        provides mechanisms to create offers and answers, as well as to
        apply them to a session. However, the JSEP implementation is
        totally decoupled from the actual mechanism by which these
        offers and answers are communicated to the remote side,
        including addressing, retransmission, forking, and glare
        handling. These issues are left entirely up to the application;
        the application has complete control over which offers and
        answers get handed to the implementation, and when.</t>

        <name>Session Descriptions and State Machine</name>
        <t>In order to establish the media plane, the JSEP
        implementation needs specific parameters to indicate what to
        transmit to the remote side, as well as how to handle the media
        that is received. These parameters are determined by the
        exchange of session descriptions in offers and answers, and
        there are certain details to this process that must be handled
        in the JSEP APIs.</t>
        <t>Whether a session description applies to the local side or
        the remote side affects the meaning of that description. For
        example, the list of codecs sent to a remote party indicates
        what the local side is willing to receive, which, when
        intersected with the set of codecs the remote side supports,
        specifies what the remote side should send. However, not all
        parameters follow this rule; some parameters are declarative,
        and the remote side <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> either accept them or reject them
        altogether. An example of such a parameter is the DTLS
        fingerprints
        <xref target="RFC8122" format="default"/>, which are calculated based on
        the local certificate(s) offered and are not subject to
        negotiation.

<!-- [rfced] Section 3.2:  We do not see any mention of DTLS in
RFC 8122; we only see "TLS."  Will this citation be clear to
readers?

Original:
 An example of such a parameter is the DTLS
 fingerprints [RFC8122], which are calculated based on the local
 certificate(s) offered, and are not subject to negotiation.

Possibly:
 An example of such a parameter is the TLS
 fingerprints [RFC8122] as used in the context of DTLS [RFC6347];
 these fingerprints are calculated based on the local certificate(s)
 offered and are not subject to negotiation. -->

</t>
        <t>In addition, various RFCs put different conditions on the
        format of offers versus answers. For example, an offer may
        propose an arbitrary number of "m=" sections (i.e., media
        descriptions as described in
        <xref target="RFC4566" sectionFormat="comma" section="5.14"/>), but an answer must
        contain the exact same number as the offer.</t>
        <t>Lastly, while the exact media parameters are known only
        after an offer and an answer have been exchanged, the offerer
        may receive ICE checks, and possibly media (e.g., in the case
        of a re-offer after a connection has been established) before
        it receives an answer. To properly process incoming media in
        this case, the offerer's media handler must be aware of the
        details of the offer before the answer arrives.</t>
        <t>Therefore, in order to handle session descriptions properly,
        the JSEP implementation needs:
        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
          <li>To know if a session description pertains to the local or
          remote side.</li>
          <li>To know if a session description is an offer or an
          answer.</li>
          <li>To allow the offer to be specified independently of the
          answer.</li>
        </ol>
        <t>JSEP addresses this by adding both setLocalDescription
        and setRemoteDescription methods and having session description
        objects contain a type field indicating the type of session
        description being supplied. This satisfies the requirements
        listed above for both the offerer, who first calls
        setLocalDescription(sdp [offer]) and then later
        setRemoteDescription(sdp [answer]), and the
        answerer, who first calls setRemoteDescription(sdp [offer]) and
        then later setLocalDescription(sdp [answer]).</t>
        <t>During the offer/answer exchange, the outstanding offer is
        considered to be "pending" at the offerer and the answerer, as
        it may be either accepted or rejected. If this is a re-offer,
        each side will also have "current" local and remote
        descriptions, which reflect the result of the last offer/answer
        exchange. Sections
        <xref target="sec.pendinglocaldescription" format="counter"/>,
        <xref target="sec.pendingremotedescription" format="counter"/>,
        <xref target="sec.currentlocaldescription" format="counter"/>, and
        <xref target="sec.currentremotedescription" format="counter"/> provide more
        detail on pending and current descriptions.</t>
        <t>JSEP also allows for an answer to be treated as provisional
        by the application. Provisional answers provide a way for an
        answerer to communicate initial session parameters back to the
        offerer, in order to allow the session to begin, while allowing
        a final answer to be specified later. This concept of a final
        answer is important to the offer/answer model; when such an
        answer is received, any extra resources allocated by the caller
        can be released, now that the exact session configuration is
        known. These "resources" can include things like extra ICE
        components, Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) candidates, or video decoders. Provisional
        answers, on the other hand, do no such deallocation; as a
        result, multiple dissimilar provisional answers, with their own
        codec choices, transport parameters, etc., can be received and
        applied during call setup. Note that the final answer itself
        may be different than any received provisional answers.</t>
        <t>In
        <xref target="RFC3264" format="default"/>, the constraint at the signaling
        level is that only one offer can be outstanding for a given
        session, but at the media stack level, a new offer can be
        generated at any point. For example, when using SIP for
        signaling, if one offer is sent and is then canceled using a SIP
        CANCEL, another offer can be generated even though no answer
        was received for the first offer. To support this, the JSEP
        media layer can provide an offer via the createOffer() method
        whenever the JavaScript application needs one for the
        signaling. The answerer can send back zero or more provisional
        answers and then finally end the offer/answer exchange by sending a
        final answer. The state machine for this is as follows:</t>

        <name>Session Description Format</name>
        <t>JSEP's session descriptions use Session Description Protocol (SDP) syntax for their
        internal representation. While this format is not optimal for
        manipulation from JavaScript, it is widely accepted and is
        frequently updated with new features; any alternate encoding of
        session descriptions would have to keep pace with the changes
        to SDP, at least until the time that this new encoding eclipsed
        SDP in popularity.</t>
        <t>However, to provide for future flexibility, the SDP syntax
        is encapsulated within a SessionDescription object, which can
        be constructed from SDP and be serialized out to SDP. If
        future specifications agree on a JSON format for session
        descriptions, we could easily enable this object to generate
        and consume that JSON.</t>
        <t>As detailed below, most applications should be able to treat
        the SessionDescriptions produced and consumed by these various
        API calls as opaque blobs; that is, the application will not
        need to read or change them.</t>

          <t>RtpTransceivers allow the application to control the RTP
          media associated with one "m=" section. Each RtpTransceiver has
          an RtpSender and an RtpReceiver, which an application can use
          to control the sending and receiving of RTP media. The
          application may also modify the RtpTransceiver directly, for
          instance, by stopping it.</t>
          <t>RtpTransceivers generally have a 1:1 mapping with "m="
          sections, although there may be more RtpTransceivers than "m="
          sections when RtpTransceivers are created but not yet
          associated with an "m=" section, or if RtpTransceivers have been
          stopped and disassociated from "m=" sections. An RtpTransceiver
          is said to be associated with an "m=" section if its
          media identification (mid) property is non-null; otherwise, it is said to be
          disassociated. The associated "m=" section is determined using
          a mapping between transceivers and "m=" section indices, formed
          when creating an offer or applying a remote offer.</t>
          <t>An RtpTransceiver is never associated with more than one
          "m=" section, and once a session description is applied, an "m="
          section is always associated with exactly one RtpTransceiver.

          <name>ICE Gathering Overview</name>
          <t>JSEP gathers ICE candidates as needed by the application.
          Collection of ICE candidates is referred to as a gathering
          phase, and this is triggered either by the addition of a new
          or recycled "m=" section to the local session description or by
          new ICE credentials in the description, indicating an ICE
          restart. Use of new ICE credentials can be triggered
          explicitly by the application or implicitly by the JSEP
          implementation in response to changes in the ICE
          configuration.</t>
          <t>When the ICE configuration changes in a way that requires
          a new gathering phase, a 'needs-ice-restart' bit is set. When
          this bit is set, calls to the createOffer API will generate
          new ICE credentials. This bit is cleared by a call to the
          setLocalDescription API with new ICE credentials from either
          an offer or an answer, i.e., from either a locally or
          remotely initiated ICE restart.</t>
          <t>When a new gathering phase starts, the ICE agent will
          notify the application that gathering is occurring through an
          event. Then, when each new ICE candidate becomes available,
          the ICE agent will supply it to the application via an
          additional event; these candidates will also automatically be
          added to the current and/or pending local session
          description. Finally, when all candidates have been gathered,
          an event will be dispatched to signal that the gathering
          process is complete.</t>
          <t>Note that gathering phases only gather the candidates
          needed by new/recycled/restarting "m=" sections; other "m="
          sections continue to use their existing candidates. Also, if
          an "m=" section is bundled (either by a successful bundle
          negotiation or by being marked as bundle-only), then
          candidates will be gathered and exchanged for that "m=" section
          if and only if its MID item is a BUNDLE-tag, as described in
          <xref target="RFC8843" format="default"/>.</t>

        <section anchor="sec.ice-candidate-trickling" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>ICE Candidate Trickling</name>
          <t>Candidate trickling is a technique through which a caller
          may incrementally provide candidates to the callee after the
          initial offer has been dispatched; the semantics of "Trickle
          ICE" are defined in
          <xref target="RFC8838" format="default"/>. This process
          allows the callee to begin acting upon the call and setting
          up the ICE (and perhaps DTLS) connections immediately,
          without having to wait for the caller to gather all possible
          candidates. This results in faster media setup in cases where
          gathering is not performed prior to initiating the call.</t>
          <t>JSEP supports optional candidate trickling by providing
          APIs, as described above, that provide control and feedback
          on the ICE candidate gathering process. Applications that
          support candidate trickling can send the initial offer
          immediately and send individual candidates when they get
          notified of a new candidate; applications that do not support
          this feature can simply wait for the indication that
          gathering is complete, and then create and send their offer,
          with all the candidates, at that time.</t>
          <t>Upon receipt of trickled candidates, the receiving
          application will supply them to its ICE agent. This triggers
          the ICE agent to start using the new remote candidates for
          connectivity checks.</t>
          <section anchor="sec.ice-candidate-format" numbered="true" toc="default">
            <name>ICE Candidate Format</name>
            <t>In JSEP, ICE candidates are abstracted by an
            IceCandidate object, and as with session descriptions, SDP
            syntax is used for the internal representation.</t>
            <t>The candidate details are specified in an IceCandidate
            field, using the same SDP syntax as the
            "candidate-attribute" field defined in
            <xref target="RFC8839" sectionFormat="comma" section="5.1"/>. Note that this
            field does not contain an "a=" prefix, as indicated in the
            following example:</t>

            <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[
candidate:1 1 UDP 1694498815 192.0.2.33 10000 typ host ]]></sourcecode>
            <t>The IceCandidate object contains a field to indicate
            which ICE ufrag it is associated with, as defined in
            <xref target="RFC8839" sectionFormat="comma" section="5.4"/>. This value is used
            to determine which session description (and thereby which
            gathering phase) this IceCandidate belongs to, which helps
            resolve ambiguities during ICE restarts. If this field is
            absent in a received IceCandidate (perhaps when
            communicating with a non-JSEP endpoint), the most recently
            received session description is assumed.</t>
            <t>The IceCandidate object also contains fields to indicate
            which "m=" section it is associated with, which can be
            identified in one of two ways: either by an "m=" section
            index or by a MID. The "m=" section index is a zero-based
            index, with index N referring to the N+1th "m=" section in
            the session description referenced by this IceCandidate.
            The MID is a "media stream identification" value, as
            defined in
            <xref target="RFC5888" sectionFormat="comma" section="4"/>, which provides a
            more robust way to identify the "m=" section in the session
            description, using the MID of the associated RtpTransceiver
            object (which may have been locally generated by the
            answerer when interacting with a non-JSEP endpoint that
            does not support the MID attribute, as discussed in
            <xref target="sec.applying-a-remote-desc" format="default"/> below). If the
            MID field is present in a received IceCandidate, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
            used for identification; otherwise, the "m=" section index is
            used instead.</t>
            <t>When creating an IceCandidate object, JSEP
            implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> populate each of the candidate, ufrag,

RFC 8839 and per other documents in this cluster, we hyphenated the
term "server reflexive".  Please let us know any objections.

 learning your public IP address by removing server-reflexive
 candidates. -->

 However, in
          certain cases, applications may want to have more specific
          control over the gathering process, due to privacy or related
          concerns. For example, one may want to only use relay
          candidates, to leak as little location information as
          possible (keeping in mind that this choice comes with
          corresponding operational costs). To accomplish this, JSEP
          allows the application to restrict which ICE candidates are
          used in a session. Note that this filtering is applied on top
          of any restrictions the implementation chooses to enforce
          regarding which IP addresses are permitted for the
          application, as discussed in
          <xref target="RFC8828" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>There may also be cases where the application wants to
          change which types of candidates are used while the session
          is active. A prime example is where a callee may initially
          want to use only relay candidates, to avoid leaking location
          information to an arbitrary caller, but then change to use
          all candidates (for lower operational cost) once the user has
          indicated that they want to take the call. For this scenario, the
          JSEP implementation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> allow the candidate policy to be
          changed in mid-session, subject to the aforementioned
          interactions with local policy.</t>
          <t>To administer the ICE candidate policy, the JSEP
          implementation will determine the current setting at the
          start of each gathering phase. Then, during the gathering
          phase, the implementation <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> expose candidates
          disallowed by the current policy to the application, use them
          as the source of connectivity checks, or indirectly expose
          them via other fields, such as the raddr/rport attributes for
          other ICE candidates. Later, if a different policy is
          specified by the application, the application can apply it by
          kicking off a new gathering phase via an ICE restart.</t>

          <name>ICE Candidate Pool</name>
          <t>JSEP applications typically inform the JSEP implementation
          to begin ICE gathering via the information supplied to
          setLocalDescription, as the local description indicates the
          number of ICE components that will be needed and for which
          candidates must be gathered. However, to accelerate cases
          where the application knows the number of ICE components to
          use ahead of time, it may ask the implementation to gather a
          pool of potential ICE candidates to help ensure rapid media
          setup.</t>
<!-- [rfced] We suggest clarifying "goes to gather" - perhaps "gathers",
"starts to gather", "prepares to gather", etc.  "goes to gather" may be
confusing for some readers. 

Original:
   When setLocalDescription is eventually called, and the JSEP
   implementation goes to gather the needed ICE candidates, it SHOULD

          <t>When setLocalDescription is eventually called and the

          be handed to the application immediately via the ICE
          candidate event. If the pool becomes depleted, either because
          a larger-than-expected number of ICE components are used or
          because the pool has not had enough time to gather
          candidates, the remaining candidates are gathered as usual.
          This only occurs for the first offer/answer exchange, after
          which the candidate pool is emptied and no longer used.</t>
          <t>One example of where this concept is useful is an
          application that expects an incoming call at some point in
          the future, and wants to minimize the time it takes to
          establish connectivity, to avoid clipping of initial media.
          By pre-gathering candidates into the pool, it can exchange
          and start sending connectivity checks from these candidates
          almost immediately upon receipt of a call. Note, though, that
          by holding on to these pre-gathered candidates, which will be
          kept alive as long as they may be needed, the application
          will consume resources on the STUN/TURN servers it is
          using. ("STUN" stands for "Session Traversal Utilities for NAT".)</t>

        <name>Video Size Negotiation</name>
        <t>Video size negotiation is the process through which a
        receiver can use the "a=imageattr" SDP attribute
        <xref target="RFC6236" format="default"/> to indicate what video frame sizes it
        is capable of receiving. A receiver may have hard limits on
        what its video decoder can process, or it may have some maximum
        set by policy. By specifying these limits in an "a=imageattr"
        attribute, JSEP endpoints can attempt to ensure that the remote
        sender transmits video at an acceptable resolution. However,
        when communicating with a non-JSEP endpoint that does not
        understand this attribute, any signaled limits may be exceeded,
        and the JSEP implementation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> handle this gracefully, e.g.,
        by discarding the video.</t>
        <t>Note that certain codecs support transmission of samples
        with aspect ratios other than 1.0 (i.e., non-square pixels).
        JSEP implementations will not transmit non-square pixels but
        <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> receive and render such video with the correct aspect
        ratio. However, sample aspect ratio has no impact on the size
        negotiation described below; all dimensions are measured in
        pixels, whether square or not.</t>
        <section anchor="sec.creating-imageattr" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Creating an imageattr Attribute</name>
          <t>The receiver will first intersect any known local limits
          (e.g., hardware decoder capabilities, local policy) to
          determine the absolute minimum and maximum sizes it can
          receive. If there are no known local limits, the
          "a=imageattr" attribute <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be omitted. If these local
          limits preclude receiving any video, i.e., the degenerate
          case of no permitted resolutions, the "a=imageattr" attribute
          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be omitted, and the "m=" section <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be marked as
          sendonly/inactive, as appropriate.</t>
          <t>Otherwise, an "a=imageattr" attribute is created with a
          "recv" direction, and the resulting resolution space formed
          from the aforementioned intersection is used to specify its
          minimum and maximum "x=" and "y=" values.</t>
          <t>The rules here express a single set of preferences, and
          therefore, the "a=imageattr" "q=" value is not important. It
          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be set to "1.0".</t>
          <t>The "a=imageattr" field is payload type specific. When all
          video codecs supported have the same capabilities, use of a
          single attribute, with the wildcard payload type (*), is
          <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>. However, when the supported video codecs have
          different limitations, specific "a=imageattr" attributes <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
          be inserted for each payload type.</t>
          <t>As an example, consider a system with a multiformat video
          decoder, which is capable of decoding any resolution from
          48x48 to 720p. In this case, the implementation would
          generate this attribute:</t>
          <t>a=imageattr:* recv [x=[48:1280],y=[48:720],q=1.0]</t>
          <t>This declaration indicates that the receiver is capable of

          pixels.</t>

          <name>Interpreting imageattr Attributes</name>
          <t>
          <xref target="RFC6236" format="default"/> defines "a=imageattr" to be an
          advisory field. This means that it does not absolutely
          constrain the video formats that the sender can use but
          gives an indication of the preferred values.</t>
          <t>This specification prescribes behavior that is more specific. When
          a MediaStreamTrack, which is producing video of a certain
          resolution (the "track resolution"), is attached to an
          RtpSender, which is encoding the track video at the same or
          lower resolution(s) (the "encoder resolutions"), and a remote
          description is applied that references the sender and
          contains valid "a=imageattr recv" attributes, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> follow
          the rules below to ensure that the sender does not transmit a
          resolution that would exceed the size criteria specified in
          the attributes. These rules <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be followed as long as the
          attributes remain present in the remote description,
          including cases in which the track changes its resolution or
          is replaced with a different track.</t>
          <t>Depending on how the RtpSender is configured, it may be
          producing a single encoding at a certain resolution or, if
          simulcast
          (<xref target="sec.simulcast" format="default"/>) has been negotiated, multiple
          encodings, each at their own specific resolution. In
          addition, depending on the configuration, each encoding may
          have the flexibility to reduce resolution when needed or may
          be locked to a specific output resolution.</t>
          <t>For each encoding being produced by the RtpSender, the set
          of "a=imageattr recv" attributes in the corresponding "m="
          section of the remote description is processed to determine
          what should be transmitted. Only attributes that reference
          the media format selected for the encoding are considered;
          each such attribute is evaluated individually, starting with
          the attribute with the highest "q=" value. If multiple
          attributes have the same "q=" value, they are evaluated in
          the order they appear in their containing "m=" section. Note
          that while JSEP endpoints will include at most one
          "a=imageattr recv" attribute per media format, JSEP endpoints
          may receive session descriptions from non-JSEP endpoints with
          "m=" sections that contain multiple such attributes.</t>
          <t>For each "a=imageattr recv" attribute, the following rules
          are applied. If this processing is successful, the encoding
          is transmitted accordingly, and no further attributes are
          considered for that encoding. Otherwise, the next attribute
          is evaluated, in the aforementioned order. If none of the
          supplied attributes can be processed successfully, the
          encoding <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be transmitted, and an error <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be
          raised to the application.
          </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>The limits from the attribute are compared to the
            encoder resolution. Only the specific limits mentioned
            below are considered; any other values, such as picture
            aspect ratio, <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be ignored. When considering a
            MediaStreamTrack that is producing rotated video, the
            unrotated resolution <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used for the checks. This is
            required regardless of whether the receiver supports
            performing receive-side rotation (e.g., through Coordination of
	    Video Orientation (CVO)
            <xref target="TS26.114" format="default"/>), as it significantly simplifies
            the matching logic.</li>

            value set to something other than "1.0", indicating that the

            <li>If the encoder resolution exceeds the maximum size
            permitted by the attribute and the encoder is allowed to
            adjust its resolution, the encoder <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> apply downscaling
            in order to satisfy the limits. Downscaling <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> change
            the picture aspect ratio of the encoding, ignoring any
            trivial differences due to rounding. For example, if the
            encoder resolution is 1280x720 and the attribute specified
            a maximum of 640x480, the expected output resolution would
            be 640x360. If downscaling cannot be applied, the attribute
            <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used.</li>
            <li>If the encoder resolution is less than the minimum size
            permitted by the attribute, the attribute <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used;
            the encoder <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> apply upscaling. JSEP implementations
            <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> avoid this situation by allowing receipt of
            arbitrarily small resolutions, perhaps via fallback to a
            software decoder.</li>
            <li>If the encoder resolution is within the maximum and

        <name>Simulcast</name>
        <t>JSEP supports simulcast transmission of a MediaStreamTrack,
        where multiple encodings of the source media can be transmitted
        within the context of a single "m=" section. The current JSEP API
        is designed to allow applications to send simulcasted media but
        only to receive a single encoding. This allows for multi-user
        scenarios where each sending client sends multiple encodings to
        a server, which then, for each receiving client, chooses the
        appropriate encoding to forward.</t>
        <t>Applications request support for simulcast by configuring
        multiple encodings on an RtpSender. Upon generation of an offer
        or answer, these encodings are indicated via SDP markings on
        the corresponding "m=" section, as described below. Receivers
        that understand simulcast and are willing to receive it will
        also include SDP markings to indicate their support, and JSEP
        endpoints will use these markings to determine whether
        simulcast is permitted for a given RtpSender. If simulcast
        support is not negotiated, the RtpSender will only use the
        first configured encoding.</t>
        <t>Note that the exact simulcast parameters are up to the
        sending application. While the aforementioned SDP markings are
        provided to ensure that the remote side can receive and demux
        multiple simulcast encodings, the specific resolutions and
        bitrates to be used for each encoding are purely a send-side
        decision in JSEP.</t>
        <t>JSEP currently does not provide a mechanism to configure
        receipt of simulcast. This means that if simulcast is offered
        by the remote endpoint, the answer generated by a JSEP endpoint
        will not indicate support for receipt of simulcast, and as such
        the remote endpoint will only send a single encoding per "m="
        section.</t>
        <t>In addition, JSEP does not provide a mechanism to handle an
        incoming offer requesting simulcast from the JSEP endpoint.
        This means that setting up simulcast in the case where the JSEP
        endpoint receives the initial offer requires out-of-band
        signaling or SDP inspection. However, in the case where the
        JSEP endpoint sets up simulcast in its initial offer, any
        established simulcast streams will continue to work upon
        receipt of an incoming re-offer. Future versions of this
        specification may add additional APIs to handle the incoming
        initial offer scenario.</t>
        <t>When using JSEP to transmit multiple encodings from an
        RtpSender, the techniques from
        <xref target="RFC8853" format="default"/> and
        <xref target="RFC8851" format="default"/> are used. Specifically,
        when multiple encodings have been configured for an RtpSender,
        the "m=" section for the RtpSender will include an "a=simulcast"
        attribute, as defined in
        <xref target="RFC8853" sectionFormat="comma" section="6.2"/>,
        with a "send" simulcast stream description that lists each
        desired encoding, and no "recv" simulcast stream description.

        <name>Interactions with Forking</name>
        <t>Some call signaling systems allow various types of forking
        where an SDP Offer may be provided to more than one device. For
        example, SIP
        <xref target="RFC3261" format="default"/> defines both a "parallel search"
        and "sequential search". Although these are primarily signaling-level issues that are outside the scope of JSEP, they do have
        some impact on the configuration of the media plane that is
        relevant. When forking happens at the signaling layer, the
        JavaScript application responsible for the signaling needs to
        make the decisions about what media should be sent or received
        at any point in time, as well as which remote endpoint it
        should communicate with; JSEP is used to make sure the media
        engine can make the RTP and media perform as required by the
        application. The basic operations that the applications can
        have the media engine do are as follows:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Start exchanging media with a given remote peer, but keep
          all the resources reserved in the offer.</li>
          <li>Start exchanging media with a given remote peer, and free
          any resources in the offer that are not being used.</li>
        </ul>
        <section anchor="sec.sequential-forking" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Sequential Forking</name>
          <t>Sequential forking involves a call being dispatched to
          multiple remote callees, where each callee can accept the
          call, but only one active session ever exists at a time; no
          mixing of received media is performed.</t>
          <t>JSEP handles sequential forking well, allowing the
          application to easily control the policy for selecting the
          desired remote endpoint. When an answer arrives from one of
          the callees, the application can choose to apply it as either
          (1)&nbsp;a provisional answer, leaving open the possibility of using a
          different answer in the future or (2)&nbsp;a final
          answer, ending the setup flow.</t>
          <t>In a "first-one-wins" situation, the first answer will be
          applied as a final answer, and the application will reject
          any subsequent answers. In SIP parlance, this would be ACK +
          BYE.</t>
          <t>In a "last-one-wins" situation, all answers would be
          applied as provisional answers, and any previous call leg
          will be terminated. At some point, the application will end
          the setup process, perhaps with a timer; at this point, the
          application could reapply the pending remote description as a

        <section anchor="sec.parallel-forking" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Parallel Forking</name>
          <t>Parallel forking involves a call being dispatched to
          multiple remote callees, where each callee can accept the
          call and multiple simultaneous active signaling sessions can
          be established as a result. If multiple callees send media at
          the same time, the possibilities for handling this are
          described in
          <xref target="RFC3960" sectionFormat="comma" section="3.1"/>. Most SIP devices
          today only support exchanging media with a single device at a
          time and do not try to mix multiple early media audio
          sources, as that could result in a confusing situation. For
          example, consider having a European ringback tone mixed
          together with the North American ringback tone -- the
          resulting sound would not be like either tone and would
          confuse the user. If the signaling application wishes to only
          exchange media with one of the remote endpoints at a time,
          then from a media engine point of view, this is exactly like
          the sequential forking case.</t>
          <t>In the parallel forking case where the JavaScript
          application wishes to simultaneously exchange media with
          multiple peers, the flow is slightly more complex, but the
          JavaScript application can follow the strategy that
          <xref target="RFC3960" format="default"/> describes, using UPDATE. The
          UPDATE approach allows the signaling to set up a separate
          media flow for each peer that it wishes to exchange media
          with. In JSEP, this offer used in the UPDATE would be formed
          by simply creating a new PeerConnection (see
          <xref target="sec.peerconnection" format="default"/>) and making sure that
          the same local media streams have been added into this new
          PeerConnection. Then the new PeerConnection object would
          produce an SDP offer that could be used by the signaling to
          perform the UPDATE strategy discussed in
          <xref target="RFC3960" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>As a result of sharing the media streams, the application
          will end up with N parallel PeerConnection sessions, each
          with a local and remote description and their own local and
          remote addresses. The media flow from these sessions can be
          managed using setDirection (see
          <xref target="sec.transceiver-set-direction" format="default"/>), or the
          application can choose to play out the media from all
          sessions mixed together. Of course, if the application wants
          to only keep a single session, it can simply terminate the
          sessions that it no longer needs.</t>

          <t>The application can specify its preferred policy regarding
          use of bundle, the multiplexing mechanism defined in
          <xref target="RFC8843" format="default">
            </xref>. Regardless of policy, the application will always
          try to negotiate bundle onto a single transport and will
          offer a single bundle group across all "m=" sections; use of
          this single transport is contingent upon the answerer
          accepting bundle. However, by specifying a policy from the
          list below, the application can control exactly how
          aggressively it will try to bundle media streams together,
          which affects how it will interoperate with a
          non-bundle-aware endpoint. When negotiating with a
          non-bundle-aware endpoint, only the streams not marked as
          bundle-only streams will be established.</t>
          <t>The set of available policies is as follows:
          </t>
          <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
            <dt>balanced:</dt>
            <dd>The first "m=" section of each type
            (audio, video, or application) will contain transport
            parameters, which will allow an answerer to unbundle that
            section. The second and any subsequent "m=" sections of each
            type will be marked bundle-only. The result is that if
            there are N distinct media types, then candidates will be
            gathered for N media streams. This policy balances
            desire to multiplex with the need to ensure that basic audio and
            video can still be negotiated in legacy cases. When acting
            as answerer, if there is no bundle group in the offer, the
            implementation will reject all but the first "m=" section of
            each type.</dd>
            <dt>max-compat:</dt>
            <dd>All "m=" sections will contain
            transport parameters; none will be marked as bundle-only.
            This policy will allow all streams to be received by
            non-bundle-aware endpoints but will require separate candidates
            to be gathered for each media stream.</dd>
            <dt>max-bundle:</dt>
            <dd>Only the first "m=" section will
            contain transport parameters; all streams other than the
            first will be marked as bundle-only. This policy aims to
            minimize candidate gathering and maximize multiplexing, at
            the cost of less compatibility with legacy endpoints. When
            acting as answerer, the implementation will reject any "m="
            sections other than the first "m=" section, unless they are
            in the same bundle group as that "m=" section.</dd>
          </dl>
          <t>As it provides the best trade-off between performance and
          compatibility with legacy endpoints, the default bundle

          application to trigger an ICE restart, for the purpose of
          reestablishing connectivity.</t>
          <t>In the initial offer, the generated SDP will contain all
          desired functionality for the session (functionality that is
          supported but not desired by default may be omitted); for
          each SDP line, the generation of the SDP will follow the

          <t>In the event createOffer is called after the session is

          requesting an ICE restart. For each existing stream, the

          the given SDP line. For each new stream, the generation of
          the SDP must follow the process of generating an initial

          changed.</t>
          <t>"offer" indicates that a description should be parsed as
          an offer; said description may include many possible media
          configurations. A description used as an "offer" may be
          applied any time the PeerConnection is in a stable state or
          applied as an update to a previously supplied but unanswered
          "offer".</t>
          <t>"pranswer" indicates that a description should be parsed
          as an answer, but not a final answer, and so should not
          result in the freeing of allocated resources. It may result
          in the start of media transmission, if the answer does not
          specify an inactive media direction. A description used as a
          "pranswer" may be applied as a response to an "offer" or as an
          update to a previously sent "pranswer".</t>
          <t>"answer" indicates that a description should be parsed as
          an answer, the offer/answer exchange should be considered
          complete, and any resources (decoders, candidates) that are
          no longer needed can be released. A description used as an
          "answer" may be applied as a response to an "offer" or as an
          update to a previously sent "pranswer".</t>
          <t>The only difference between a provisional and final answer
          is that the final answer results in the freeing of any unused

          such, the application can use some discretion on whether an
          answer should be applied as provisional or final and can
          change the type of the session description as needed. For
          example, in a serial forking scenario, an application may
          receive multiple "final" answers, one from each remote
          endpoint. The application could choose to accept the initial

          final when it receives one that meets its criteria (e.g., a
          live user instead of voicemail).</t>
          <t>"rollback" is a special session description type implying

            <t>Most applications will not need to create answers using
            the "pranswer" type. While it is good practice to send an
            immediate response to an offer, in order to warm up the
            session transport and prevent media clipping, the preferred
            handling for a JSEP application is to create and send a
            "sendonly" final answer with a null MediaStreamTrack
            immediately after receiving the offer, which will prevent
            media from being sent by the caller and allow media to be
            sent immediately upon answer by the callee. Later, when the
            callee actually accepts the call, the application can plug
            in the real MediaStreamTrack and create a new "sendrecv"
            offer to update the previous offer/answer pair and start
            bidirectional media flow. While this could also be done
            with a "sendonly" pranswer, followed by a "sendrecv"
            answer, the initial pranswer leaves the offer/answer
            exchange open, which means that the caller cannot send an
            updated offer during this time.

            <t>As an example, consider a typical JSEP application that
            wants to set up audio and video as quickly as possible.
            When the callee receives an offer with audio and video
            MediaStreamTracks, it will send an immediate answer
            accepting these tracks as sendonly (meaning that the caller
            will not send the callee any media yet, and because the
            callee has not yet added its own MediaStreamTracks, the
            callee will not send any media either). It will then ask
            the user to accept the call and acquire the needed local
            tracks. Upon acceptance by the user, the application will
            plug in the tracks it has acquired, which, because ICE handshaking
	    and DTLS handshaking have likely completed by this point, can
            start transmitting immediately.

 The application will also
            send a new offer to the remote side indicating call
            acceptance and moving the audio and video to be two-way

            <t>Of course, some applications may not be able to perform
            this double offer/answer exchange, particularly ones that
            are attempting to gateway to legacy signaling protocols. In

            <t>In certain situations, it may be desirable to "undo" a
            change made to setLocalDescription or setRemoteDescription.
            Consider a case where a call is ongoing and one side wants
            to change some of the session parameters; that side
            generates an updated offer and then calls
            setLocalDescription. However, the remote side, either

            want to accept the new parameters and sends a reject
            message back to the offerer. Now, the offerer, and possibly
            the answerer as well, needs to return to a stable state and
            the previous local/remote description. To support this, we
            introduce the concept of "rollback", which discards any
            proposed changes to the session, returning the state
            machine to the stable state. A rollback is performed by

          <t>This API changes the local media state; among other
          things, it sets up local resources for receiving and decoding
          media. In order to successfully handle scenarios where the
          application wants to offer to change from one media format to
          a different, incompatible format, the PeerConnection must be
          able to simultaneously support use of both the current and
          pending local descriptions (e.g., support the codecs that
          exist in either description). This dual processing begins
          when the PeerConnection enters the "have-local-offer" state,
          and it continues until setRemoteDescription is called with
          either (1)&nbsp;a final answer, at which point the PeerConnection can
          fully adopt the pending local description or (2)&nbsp;a rollback,
          which results in a revert to the current local
          description.</t>
          <t>This API indirectly controls the candidate gathering
          process. When a local description is supplied and the number
          of transports currently in use does not match the number of
          transports needed by the local description, the
          PeerConnection will create transports as needed and begin
          gathering candidates for each transport, using ones from the
          candidate pool if available.</t>
          <t>If setRemoteDescription was previously called with an
          offer, and setLocalDescription is called with an answer
          (provisional or final), and the media directions are
          compatible, and media is available to send, this will result
          in the starting of media transmission.

          <xref target="RFC5764" format="default"/> as well as the "TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF"
          profile specified in <xref target="RFC7850" format="default"/> and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> indicate
          one of these profiles for each media "m=" line they produce in an offer.
          For data "m=" sections, implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support the
          "UDP/DTLS/SCTP" profile as well as the "TCP/DTLS/SCTP" profile and
          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> indicate one of these profiles for each data "m=" line they produce
          in an offer. The exact profile to use is determined by the protocol
          associated with the current default or selected ICE candidate, as
          described in
          <xref target="RFC8839" sectionFormat="comma" section="4.2.1.2"/>.</t>
          <t>Unfortunately, in an attempt at compatibility, some
          endpoints generate other profile strings even when they mean
          to support one of these profiles. For instance, an endpoint
          might generate "RTP/AVP" but supply "a=fingerprint" and
          "a=rtcp-fb" attributes, indicating its willingness to support
          "UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF" or "TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF". In order to
          simplify compatibility with such endpoints, JSEP
          implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> follow the following rules when
          processing the media "m=" sections in a received offer:</t>

              <t>Any profile in the offer matching one of the following

            <li>The profile in any "m=" line in any generated answer

            <li>Because DTLS-SRTP is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>, the choice of SAVP or
              AVP has no effect; support for DTLS-SRTP is determined by
              the presence of one or more "a=fingerprint" attributes.
              Note that lack of an "a=fingerprint" attribute will lead
              to negotiation failure.</li>
            <li>The use of AVPF or AVP simply controls the timing
              rules used for RTCP feedback. If AVPF is provided or an
              "a=rtcp-fb" attribute is present, assume AVPF timing,
              i.e., a default value of "trr-int=0". Otherwise, assume
              that AVPF is being used in an AVP-compatible mode and use
              a value of "trr-int=4000".</li>
            <li>For data "m=" sections, implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support
              receiving the "UDP/DTLS/SCTP", "TCP/DTLS/SCTP", or

          </ul>
          <t>Note that re-offers by JSEP implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use the
          correct profile strings even if the initial offer/answer
          exchange used an (incorrect) older profile string. This
          simplifies JSEP behavior, with minimal downside, as any
          remote endpoint that fails to handle such a re-offer will
          also fail to handle a JSEP endpoint's initial offer.</t>

Per <https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/FAQ-xml2rfcv3.html>,

features previously not available).  Please note that superscript
will display in the .html and .pdf files but not in the .txt file
(where it appears as "(2^(63))-1").  We added the "superscript"

          However, whether the "m=" sections are bundle-only or not
          depends on the bundle policy.</t>
          <t>The next step is to generate session-level lip sync groups
          as defined in
          <xref target="RFC5888" sectionFormat="comma" section="7"/>. For each MediaStream
          referenced by more than one RtpTransceiver (by passing those
          MediaStreams as arguments to the addTrack and addTransceiver
          methods), a group of type "LS" <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be added that contains
          the mid values for each RtpTransceiver.</t>
          <t>Attributes that SDP permits to be at either the session
          level or the media level <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> generally be at the media
          level even if they are identical. This assists development
          and debugging by making it easier to understand individual
          media sections, especially if one of a set of initially
          identical attributes is subsequently changed. However,
          implementations <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> choose to aggregate attributes at the
          session level, and JSEP implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be prepared to
          receive attributes in either location.</t>
          <t>Attributes other than the ones specified above <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be
          included, except for the following attributes, which are
          specifically incompatible with the requirements of
          <xref target="RFC8834" format="default"/> and <bcp14>MUST

          <t>Note that when bundle is used, any additional attributes

          <t>Note that these requirements are in some cases stricter

            by one on each call to createOffer if the offer might
            differ from the output of the previous call to createOffer;
            implementations <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> opt to increment
            &lt;session-version&gt; on every call. The value of the
            generated &lt;session-version&gt; is independent of the
            &lt;session-version&gt; of the current local description;
            in particular, in the case where the current version is N,
            an offer is created and applied with version N+1, and then
            that offer is rolled back so that the current version is

            For example, when using the Opus codec, the "usedtx=0"

 [I-D.ietf-ice-trickle], Section 3, and the "ice2" option as specified
 in [RFC8445], Section 10, is only included if such an option was
 present in the offer.

We updated as follows.  As noted previously, (1) for ease of the
reader and (2) to create a usable hyperlink in the .html file, we
changed "the initial offers section above" to "Section 5.2.1 above."

Currently:
 The first step in generating an initial answer is to generate
 session-level attributes.  The process here is identical to that
 indicated in Section 5.2.1 above, except that the "a=ice-options"
 line, with the "trickle" option as specified in [RFC8840],
 Section 4.1.3 and the "ice2" option as specified in [RFC8445],
 Section 10, is only included if such an option was present in the
 offer. -->

          <t>The next step is to generate session-level lip sync
          groups, as defined in
          <xref target="RFC5888" sectionFormat="comma" section="7"/>. For each group of type
          "LS" present in the offer, select the local RtpTransceivers
          that are referenced by the MID values in the specified group,
          and determine which of them either reference a common local
          MediaStream (specified in the calls to
          addTrack/addTransceiver used to create them) or have no
          MediaStream to reference because they were not created by
          addTrack/addTransceiver. If at least two such RtpTransceivers
          exist, a group of type "LS" with the mid values of these
          RtpTransceivers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be added. Otherwise, the offered "LS"
          group <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be ignored and no corresponding group generated in
          the answer.</t>
          <t>As a simple example, consider the following offer of a
          single audio and single video track contained in the same
          MediaStream. SDP lines not relevant to this example have been
          removed for clarity. As explained in
          <xref target="sec-create-offer" format="default"/>, a group of type "LS" has
          been added that references each track's RtpTransceiver.</t>
          <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[
          a=group:LS a1 v1
          m=audio 10000 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 0
          a=mid:a1
          a=msid:ms1
          m=video 10001 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 96
          a=mid:v1
          a=msid:ms1 ]]></sourcecode>
          <t>If the answerer uses a single MediaStream when it adds its
          tracks, both of its transceivers will reference this stream,
          and so the subsequent answer will contain a "LS" group
          identical to that in the offer, as shown below:</t>
          <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[
          a=group:LS a1 v1
          m=audio 20000 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 0
          a=mid:a1
          a=msid:ms2
          m=video 20001 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 96
          a=mid:v1
          a=msid:ms2 ]]></sourcecode>
          <t>However, if the answerer groups its tracks into separate
          MediaStreams, its transceivers will reference different
          streams, and so the subsequent answer will not contain a "LS"
          group.</t>
          <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[
          m=audio 20000 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 0
          a=mid:a1
          a=msid:ms2a
          m=video 20001 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 96
          a=mid:v1
          a=msid:ms2b ]]></sourcecode>
          <t>Finally, if the answerer does not add any tracks, its
          transceivers will not reference any MediaStreams, causing the
          preferences of the offerer to be maintained, and so the
          subsequent answer will contain an identical "LS" group.</t>
          <sourcecode name="" type="sdp"><![CDATA[
          a=group:LS a1 v1
          m=audio 20000 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 0

          a=recvonly

          <t>The example in <xref target="sec.detailed-example" format="default"/> shows a more involved case of "LS" group
          generation.</t>

          of this discussion, any session-level attributes in the offer
          that are also valid as media-level attributes are considered
          to be present in each "m=" section. Each offered "m=" section
          will have an associated RtpTransceiver, as described in
          <xref target="sec.applying-a-remote-desc" format="default"/>. If there are
          more RtpTransceivers than there are "m=" sections, the

          <t>For each offered "m=" section, if any of the following
          conditions are true, the corresponding "m=" section in the

            on a per-codec basis (e.g., if the offerer somehow offered

            VoiceActivityDetection to "true" would result in an answer
            with CN codecs and "usedtx=0"). The impact of this rule is
            that an answerer will not try to use silence suppression
            with any endpoint that does not offer it, making silence
            suppression support bilateral even with non-JSEP

<!-- [rfced] Section 5.8.1:  We found this sentence confusing; should

Original:
 The "i=", "u=", "e=", "p=", "t=", "r=", "z=", and "k=" lines are
 not used by this specification; they MUST be checked for syntax
 but their values are not used.

We ask because we see (for example):

o  A "t=" line MUST be added, as specified in [RFC4566], Section 5.9;
    both <start-time> and <stop-time> SHOULD be set to zero, e.g. "t=0
    0".
...
 o  The "s=" and "t=" lines MUST stay the same.
...
 t=0 0 -->

	   <name>Simple Example</name>
	   <t>This section shows a very simple example that sets up a
	   minimal audio/video call between two JSEP endpoints without
	   using Trickle ICE. The example in the following section
	   provides a more detailed example of what could happen in a JSEP
	   session.</t>
	   <t>The code flow below shows Alice's endpoint initiating the
	   session to Bob's endpoint. The messages from the JavaScript
	   application in Alice's browser to the JavaScript in Bob's
	   browser, abbreviated as "AliceJS" and "BobJS", respectively, are
	   assumed to flow over some signaling protocol via a web server.
	   The JavaScript on both Alice's side and Bob's side waits for
	   all candidates before sending the offer or answer, so the
	   offers and answers are complete; Trickle ICE is not used. The
	   user agents (JSEP implementations) in Alice's and Bob's browsers,
	   abbreviated as "AliceUA" and "BobUA", respectively, are using the
	   default bundle policy of "balanced", and the default RTCP mux
	   policy of "require".

	   <name>Detailed Example</name>
	   <t>This section shows a more involved example of a session
	   between two JSEP endpoints. Trickle ICE is used in full trickle
	   mode, with a bundle policy of "max-bundle", an RTCP mux policy
	   of "require", and a single TURN server. Initially, both Alice
	   and Bob establish an audio channel and a data channel. Later,
	   Bob adds two video flows -- one for his video feed and one for
	   screen sharing, both supporting FEC -- with the video feed
	   configured for simulcast. Alice accepts these video flows but
	   does not add video flows of her own, so they are handled as
	   recvonly. Alice also specifies a maximum video decoder
	   resolution.</t>

	   <name>Early Transport Warmup Example</name>
	   <t>This example demonstrates the early-warmup technique
	   described in
	   <xref target="sec.use-of-provisional-answer" format="default"/>. Here, Alice's
	   endpoint sends an offer to Bob's endpoint to start an
	   audio/video call. Bob immediately responds with an answer that
	   accepts the audio/video "m=" sections but marks them as sendonly
	   (from his perspective), meaning that Alice will not yet send
	   media. This allows the JSEP implementation to start negotiating
	   ICE and DTLS immediately. Bob's endpoint then prompts him to
	   answer the call, and when he does, his endpoint sends a second
	   offer, which enables the audio and video "m=" sections, and
	   thereby bidirectional media transmission. The advantage of such
	   a flow is that as soon as the first answer is received, the
	   implementation can proceed with ICE and DTLS negotiation and
	   establish the session transport. If the transport setup
	   completes before the second offer is sent, then media can be
	   transmitted by the callee immediately upon
	   answering the call, minimizing perceived post-dial delay. The
	   second offer/answer exchange can also change the preferred
	   codecs or other session parameters.</t>
	   <t>This example also makes use of the "relay" ICE candidate
	   policy described in
	   <xref target="sec.ice-candidate-policy" format="default"/> to minimize the ICE
	   gathering and checking needed.</t>

	 <name>Security Considerations</name>
	 <t>The IETF has published separate documents
	 <xref target="RFC8827" format="default"/>
	   <xref target="RFC8826" format="default"/> describing the security
	 architecture for WebRTC as a whole. The remainder of this section
	 describes security considerations for this document.</t>
	 <t>While formally the JSEP interface is an API, it is better to
	 think of it as an Internet protocol, with the application
	 JavaScript being untrustworthy from the perspective of the JSEP
	 implementation. Thus, the threat model of
	 <xref target="RFC3552" format="default"/> applies. In particular, JavaScript can
	 call the API in any order and with any inputs, including
	 malicious ones. This is particularly relevant when we consider
	 the SDP that is passed to setLocalDescription(). While correct
	 API usage requires that the application pass in SDP that was
	 derived from createOffer() or createAnswer(), there is no
	 guarantee that applications do so. The JSEP implementation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
	 be prepared for the JavaScript to pass in bogus data instead.</t>
	 <t>Conversely, the application programmer needs to be aware that
	 the JavaScript does not have complete control of endpoint
	 behavior. One case that bears particular mention is that editing
	 ICE candidates out of the SDP or suppressing trickled candidates
	 does not have the expected behavior: implementations will still
	 perform checks from those candidates even if they are not sent to
	 the other side. Thus, for instance, it is not possible to prevent
	 the remote peer from learning your public IP address by removing
	 server-reflexive candidates. Applications that wish to conceal
	 their public IP address should instead configure the ICE agent to
	 use only relay candidates.</t>

<!-- [rfced] Appendix A:  Please review the following, and let us
know any concerns.

a) We changed the title of Appendix A from "Appendix A" to
"ABNF Definitions."  If this is not correct, please provide an
appropriately descriptive title.

b) Please review the citations listed in Table 1.  In many cases,
we could not see the relevant parameters listed in the cited
sections.  For example, we do not see

* any of the attributes (ptime, maxptime, rtpmap, recvonly, ...)
  listed in Section 9 of [RFC4566].
* the setup attribute mentioned in Section 3 of [RFC4145].
* the connection attribute mentioned in Sections 3 or 4 of [RFC4145].
* the "mid" attribute listed in Section 5 of [RFC5888].
* the "group" attribute listed in Section 4 of [RFC5888].

c) We do not see the attributes "framerate," "quality," or
"connection" listed anywhere else in this document.  Do they need to
be included here?

d) Please note that in order to render workable hyperlinks in the
.html/.pdf files we changed the original citation format (for example,
"[RFC5285] Section 7") to this style (for example, "Section 7 of
[RFC5285]").

e) As noted previously, it appears that most of the listed section
numbers for RFC 8839 [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice-sip-sdp] are "off by one" (i.e.,
that "4.1" should be "5.1," "4.2" should be "5.2," etc.  We have updated the
section references accordingly; please review and let us know if any
corrections are needed. 

f) Please confirm that Section 6.1 of RFC 8853 [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-simulcast] 
is the correct section to cite here.
(We ask because we could not see a relationship, other than the
mention of "simulcast" mostly in terms of simulcast streams, and also
because we see ABNF for the "a=simulcast" attribute in Section 5.1 of
RFC 8853 [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-simulcast].)

<!-- [rfced] Please let us know if any changes are needed for the
following:

a) The following terms were used inconsistently in this document.
We chose to use the latter forms.  Please let us know any objections.

 a m= / an "m=" (per published RFCs and per author feedback for other
   documents in this cluster

 q= value / "q=" value  (We also changed 'x= and y= values' to
   "x=" and "y=" values')

 a RTP / an RTP

 to true / to "true"  (per the rest of the cluster)

 to false / to "false"  (per the rest of the cluster)

 bundle-tag / BUNDLE-tag (per other documents in this cluster)

 offer-answer exchange / offer/answer exchange

 clockrate / clock rate (per RFCs 3389 and 7160)

 other than IDENTICAL and TRANSPORT / other than IDENTICAL or TRANSPORT

b) The following terms appear to be used inconsistently in this
document.  Please let us know which form is preferred.

 createOffer API / createOffer() API (We see "createAnswer() API" but
  not "createAnswer API"; however, we also see "getCapabilities API"
  and "W3C RTCPeerConnection API."  In RFC 8826 (draft-ietf-rtcweb-security), 
  we see "XMLHttpRequest() API.")

 setLocalDescription API / setLocalDescription() API
   / setRemoteDescription() API
    (We also see "whether setLocalDescription or
     setRemoteDescription is called" and "before
     setRemoteDescription() is called")

 mid identifiers / MID identifiers
  Because RFC 8843 (draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation) and
  RFC 8852 (draft-ietf-avtext-rid) define "MID" as "Media Identification," 
  would it be appropriate to use "mid values" (or "MID values"*)
  and "MIDs" instead of "mid identifiers" and "MID identifiers"?

  * We see inconsistent capitalization in this cluster of documents;
    a separate question regarding which form to use will be sent
    separately.

 "RID identifiers" and "rid-identifier":  RFC 8851 (draft-ietf-mmusic-rid) 
   defines "RID" as "restriction identifier."  Should "RID
   identifiers" and "rid-identifier" be "rid-ids" and "rid-id"
   per RFC 8851 (draft-ietf-mmusic-rid), to avoid "identifier identifier(s)"? 

 the stable state (1 instance) / the "stable" state (3 instances)
   (Also, should 'the previous stable state' be 'a previous stable
   state' (per Section 5.7) or 'the previous "stable" state'?)

 sess-id / <sess-id> (Section 5.2.1, second bullet item)

 set to zero / set to 0  (May we use the latter, because of
   '"dummy" port value of 9' in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.3.1?)

 dummy value / "dummy" value

 fmt value / "fmt" value

 mid value / "mid" value

 tls-id value / "a=tls-id" value

 "IceRestart" option / IceRestart option

 dissociate (Section 5.10) / disassociate (Sections 3.4.1 and 5.7)
   Example:  "A rollback disassociates any RtpTransceivers that were
   associated with m= sections by the application of the rolled-back
   session description (see Section 5.10 and Section 5.9)."

c) Are "canTrickleIceCandidates" (Section 4.1.15) and "canTrickle
property" (Section 5.10) distinct terms?  If so, should this
distinction be clarified in the text? -->
