      <t>This document describes the mechanisms for allowing a
      JavaScript application to control the signaling plane of a
      multimedia session via the interface specified in the W3C

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="sec.introduction">

      <t>This document describes how the W3C WEBRTC RTCPeerConnection
      interface
      <xref target="W3C.webrtc"></xref> is used to control
      the setup, management and teardown of a multimedia session.</t>
      <section title="General Design of JSEP"
      anchor="sec.general-design-of-jsep">

        <t>The thinking behind WebRTC call setup has been to fully
        specify and control the media plane, but to leave the signaling
        plane up to the application as much as possible. The rationale
        is that different applications may prefer to use different
        protocols, such as the existing SIP call signaling
        protocol, or something custom to the particular application,
        perhaps for a novel use case. In this approach, the key
        information that needs to be exchanged is the multimedia
        session description, which specifies the necessary transport
        and media configuration information necessary to establish the
        media plane.</t>

        <t>With these considerations in mind, this document describes
        the JavaScript Session Establishment Protocol (JSEP) that
        allows for full control of the signaling state machine from
        JavaScript. As described above, JSEP assumes a model in which a
        JavaScript application executes inside a runtime containing
        WebRTC APIs (the "JSEP implementation"). The JSEP
        implementation is almost entirely divorced from the core
        signaling flow, which is instead handled by the JavaScript
        making use of two interfaces: (1) passing in local and remote
        session descriptions and (2) interacting with the ICE state
        machine. The combination of the JSEP implementation and the
        JavaScript application is referred to throughout this document
        as a "JSEP endpoint".</t>

        <t>In this document, the use of JSEP is described as if it
        always occurs between two JSEP endpoints. Note though in many
        cases it will actually be between a JSEP endpoint and some kind
        of server, such as a gateway or MCU. This distinction is
        invisible to the JSEP endpoint; it just follows the
        instructions it is given via the API.</t>

        <t>JSEP's handling of session descriptions is simple and
        straightforward. Whenever an offer/answer exchange is needed,
        the initiating side creates an offer by calling a createOffer()
        API. The application then uses that offer to set up its local
        config via the setLocalDescription() API. The offer is finally
        sent off to the remote side over its preferred signaling
        mechanism (e.g., WebSockets); upon receipt of that offer, the
        remote party installs it using the setRemoteDescription()
        API.</t>

        <t>To complete the offer/answer exchange, the remote party uses
        the createAnswer() API to generate an appropriate answer,
        applies it using the setLocalDescription() API, and sends the
        answer back to the initiator over the signaling channel. When
        the initiator gets that answer, it installs it using the
        setRemoteDescription() API, and initial setup is complete. This
        process can be repeated for additional offer/answer
        exchanges.</t>

        <t>Regarding ICE
        <xref target="RFC5245"></xref>, JSEP decouples the ICE state
        machine from the overall signaling state machine, as the ICE
        state machine must remain in the JSEP implementation, because
        only the implementation has the necessary knowledge of
        candidates and other transport information. Performing this separation
        provides additional flexibility in protocols that
        decouple session descriptions from transport. For instance,
        in traditional SIP, each offer or answer is self-contained,
        including both the session descriptions and the transport
        information. However, <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice-sip"/>
        allows SIP to be used with trickle ICE
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-ice-trickle"/>, in which
        the session description can be sent immediately and the
        transport information can be sent when available.
        Sending transport information separately can
        allow for faster ICE and DTLS startup, since ICE checks can
        start as soon as any transport information is available rather
        than waiting for all of it. JSEP's decoupling of the ICE and
        signaling state machines allows it to accommodate either model.</t>

        <t>Through its abstraction of signaling, the JSEP approach does
        require the application to be aware of the signaling process.
        While the application does not need to understand the contents
        of session descriptions to set up a call, the application must
        call the right APIs at the right times, convert the session
        descriptions and ICE information into the defined messages of
        its chosen signaling protocol, and perform the reverse
        conversion on the messages it receives from the other side.</t>

        <t>One way to mitigate this is to provide a JavaScript library
        that hides this complexity from the developer; said library
        would implement a given signaling protocol along with its state
        machine and serialization code, presenting a higher level
        call-oriented interface to the application developer. For
        example, libraries exist to adapt the JSEP API into an API
        suitable for a SIP or XMPP. Thus, JSEP provides greater control
        for the experienced developer without forcing any additional
        complexity on the novice developer.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Other Approaches Considered"
      anchor="sec.other-approaches-consider">

        <t>One approach that was considered instead of JSEP was to
        include a lightweight signaling protocol. Instead of providing
        session descriptions to the API, the API would produce and
        consume messages from this protocol. While providing a more
        high-level API, this put more control of signaling within the
        JSEP implementation, forcing it to have to understand and
        handle concepts like signaling glare (see
        <xref target="RFC3264"/>, Section 4).</t>

        <t>A second approach that was considered but not chosen was to
        decouple the management of the media control objects from
        session descriptions, instead offering APIs that would control
        each component directly. This was rejected based on a feeling
        that requiring exposure of this level of complexity to the
        application programmer would not be beneficial; it would result
        in an API where even a simple example would require a
        significant amount of code to orchestrate all the needed
        interactions, as well as creating a large API surface that
        needed to be agreed upon and documented. In addition, these API
        points could be called in any order, resulting in a more
        complex set of interactions with the media subsystem than the
        JSEP approach, which specifies how session descriptions are to
        be evaluated and applied.</t>

        <t>One variation on JSEP that was considered was to keep the
        basic session description-oriented API, but to move the
        mechanism for generating offers and answers out of the JSEP
        implementation. Instead of providing createOffer/createAnswer
        methods within the implementation, this approach would instead
        expose a getCapabilities API which would provide the
        application with the information it needed in order to generate
        its own session descriptions. This increases the amount of work
        that the application needs to do; it needs to know how to
        generate session descriptions from capabilities, and especially
        how to generate the correct answer from an arbitrary offer and
        the supported capabilities. While this could certainly be
        addressed by using a library like the one mentioned above, it
        basically forces the use of said library even for a simple
        example. Providing createOffer/createAnswer avoids this
        problem.</t>

      <section title="Signaling Model" anchor="sec.signaling-model">

        <t>JSEP does not specify a particular signaling model or state
        machine, other than the generic need to exchange session
        descriptions in the fashion described by
        <xref target="RFC3264"></xref> (offer/answer) in order for both
        sides of the session to know how to conduct the session. JSEP
        provides mechanisms to create offers and answers, as well as to
        apply them to a session. However, the JSEP implementation is
        totally decoupled from the actual mechanism by which these
        offers and answers are communicated to the remote side,
        including addressing, retransmission, forking, and glare
        handling. These issues are left entirely up to the application;
        the application has complete control over which offers and
        answers get handed to the implementation, and when.</t>

      <section title="Session Descriptions and State Machine"
      anchor="sec.session-descriptions-and-state-machine">

        <t>In order to establish the media plane, the JSEP implementation needs
        specific parameters to indicate what to transmit to the remote
        side, as well as how to handle the media that is received.
        These parameters are determined by the exchange of session
        descriptions in offers and answers, and there are certain
        details to this process that must be handled in the JSEP
        APIs.</t>

        <t>Whether a session description applies to the local side or
        the remote side affects the meaning of that description. For
        example, the list of codecs sent to a remote party indicates
        what the local side is willing to receive, which, when
        intersected with the set of codecs the remote side supports,
        specifies what the remote side should send. However, not all
        parameters follow this rule; for example, the fingerprints
        <xref target="RFC8122"></xref> sent to a
        remote party are calculated based on the local certificate(s)
        offered; the remote party MUST either accept these parameters
        or reject them altogether, with no option to choose different
        values.</t>

        <t>In addition, various RFCs put different conditions on the
        format of offers versus answers. For example, an offer may
        propose an arbitrary number of m= sections (i.e., media
        descriptions as described in
        <xref target="RFC4566" />, Section 5.14), but an answer must
        contain the exact same number as the offer.</t>

        <t>Lastly, while the exact media parameters are only known only
        after an offer and an answer have been exchanged, the offerer may
        receive ICE checks, and possibly media (e.g., in the case of a
        re-offer after a connection has been established)
        before it receives an answer. To properly
        process incoming media in this case, the offerer's media
        handler must be aware of the details of the offer before the
        answer arrives.</t>

        <t>Therefore, in order to handle session descriptions properly,
        the JSEP implementation needs:
        <list style="numbers">

          <t>To know if a session description pertains to the local or
          remote side.</t>

          <t>To know if a session description is an offer or an
          answer.</t>

          <t>To allow the offer to be specified independently of the
          answer.</t>
        </list>JSEP addresses this by adding both setLocalDescription
        and setRemoteDescription methods and having session description
        objects contain a type field indicating the type of session
        description being supplied. This satisfies the requirements
        listed above for both the offerer, who first calls
        setLocalDescription(sdp [offer]) and then later
        setRemoteDescription(sdp [answer]), as well as for the
        answerer, who first calls setRemoteDescription(sdp [offer]) and
        then later setLocalDescription(sdp [answer]).</t>

        <t>JSEP also allows for an answer to be treated as provisional
        by the application. Provisional answers provide a way for an
        answerer to communicate initial session parameters back to the
        offerer, in order to allow the session to begin, while allowing
        a final answer to be specified later. This concept of a final
        answer is important to the offer/answer model; when such an
        answer is received, any extra resources allocated by the caller
        can be released, now that the exact session configuration is
        known. These "resources" can include things like extra ICE
        components, TURN candidates, or video decoders. Provisional
        answers, on the other hand, do no such deallocation; as a
        result, multiple dissimilar provisional answers, with their own
        codec choices, transport parameters, etc., can be received and
        applied during call setup. Note that the final answer itself
        may be different than any received provisional answers.</t>

        <t>In
        <xref target="RFC3264"></xref>, the constraint at the signaling
        level is that only one offer can be outstanding for a given
        session, but at the media stack level, a new offer can be
        generated at any point. For example, when using SIP for
        signaling, if one offer is sent, then cancelled using a SIP
        CANCEL, another offer can be generated even though no answer
        was received for the first offer. To support this, the JSEP
        media layer can provide an offer via the createOffer() method
        whenever the JavaScript application needs one for the
        signaling. The answerer can send back zero or more provisional
        answers, and finally end the offer-answer exchange by sending a
        final answer. The state machine for this is as follows:</t>

      <section title="Session Description Format"
      anchor="sec.session-description-forma">

        <t>JSEP's session descriptions use SDP syntax for their
        internal representation. While this format is not optimal for
        manipulation from JavaScript, it is widely accepted, and
        frequently updated with new features; any alternate encoding of
        session descriptions would have to keep pace with the changes
        to SDP, at least until the time that this new encoding eclipsed
        SDP in popularity.</t>

        <t>However, to provide for
        future flexibility, the SDP syntax is encapsulated within a
        SessionDescription object, which can be constructed from SDP,
        and be serialized out to SDP. If future specifications agree on
        a JSON format for session descriptions, we could easily enable
        this object to generate and consume that JSON.</t>

        <t>As detailed below, most applications should be able to treat the
        SessionDescriptions produced and consumed by these various API
        calls as opaque blobs; that is, the application will not need
        to read or change them.</t>

      <section title="Session Description Control"
      anchor="sec.session-description-ctrl">

        <t>In order to give the application control over various common
        session parameters, JSEP provides control surfaces which tell
        the JSEP implementation how to generate session descriptions.
        This avoids the need for JavaScript to modify session
        descriptions in most cases.</t>

        <t>Changes to these objects result in changes to the session
        descriptions generated by subsequent createOffer/Answer
        calls.</t>
        <section title="RtpTransceivers" anchor="sec.rtptransceivers">

          <t>RtpTransceivers allow the application to control the RTP
          media associated with one m= section. Each RtpTransceiver has
          an RtpSender and an RtpReceiver, which an application can use
          to control the sending and receiving of RTP media. The
          application may also modify the RtpTransceiver directly, for
          instance, by stopping it.</t>

          <t>RtpTransceivers generally have a 1:1 mapping with m=
          sections, although there may be more RtpTransceivers than m=
          sections when RtpTransceivers are created but not yet
          associated with a m= section, or if RtpTransceivers have been
          stopped and disassociated from m= sections. An RtpTransceiver
          is said to be associated with an m= section if its mid
          property is non-null; otherwise it is said to be
          disassociated. The associated m= section is determined using
          a mapping between transceivers and m= section indices, formed
          when creating an offer or applying a remote offer.</t>

          <t>An RtpTransceiver is never associated with more than one m=
          section, and once a session description is applied, a m=
          section is always associated with exactly one
          RtpTransceiver. However, in certain cases where a m= section has been
          rejected, as discussed in <xref target="sec.subsequent-offers"/>
          below, that m= section will be "recycled" and associated
          with a new RtpTransceiver with a new mid value.</t>

          <t>RtpTransceivers can be created explicitly by the
          application or implicitly by calling setRemoteDescription
          with an offer that adds new m= sections.</t>

        <section title="ICE Gathering Overview"
        anchor="sec.ice-gather-overview">

          <t>JSEP gathers ICE candidates as needed by the application.
          Collection of ICE candidates is referred to as a gathering
          phase, and this is triggered either by the addition of a new
          or recycled m= section to the local session description, or
          new ICE credentials in the description, indicating an ICE
          restart. Use of new ICE credentials can be triggered
          explicitly by the application, or implicitly by the JSEP
          implementation in response to changes in the ICE
          configuration.</t>

          <t>When the ICE configuration changes in a way that requires
          a new gathering phase, a 'needs-ice-restart' bit is set. When
          this bit is set, calls to the createOffer API will generate
          new ICE credentials. This bit is cleared by a call to the
          setLocalDescription API with new ICE credentials from either
          an offer or an answer, i.e., from either a local- or
          remote-initiated ICE restart.</t>

          <t>When a new gathering phase starts, the ICE agent will
          notify the application that gathering is occurring through an
          event. Then, when each new ICE candidate becomes available,
          the ICE agent will supply it to the application via an
          additional event; these candidates will also automatically be
          added to the current and/or pending local session
          description. Finally, when all candidates have been gathered,
          an event will be dispatched to signal that the gathering
          process is complete.</t>

          <t>Note that gathering phases only gather the candidates
          needed by new/recycled/restarting m= sections; other m=
          sections continue to use their existing candidates. Also,
          if an m= section is bundled (either by a successful bundle
          negotiation or by being marked as bundle-only), then candidates will be gathered
          and exchanged for that m= section if and only if its MID
          is a BUNDLE-tag, as described in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation" />.

        <section title="ICE Candidate Trickling"
        anchor="sec.ice-candidate-trickling">

          <t>Candidate trickling is a technique through which a caller
          may incrementally provide candidates to the callee after the
          initial offer has been dispatched; the semantics of "Trickle
          ICE" are defined in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-ice-trickle"></xref>. This process
          allows the callee to begin acting upon the call and setting
          up the ICE (and perhaps DTLS) connections immediately,
          without having to wait for the caller to gather all possible
          candidates. This results in faster media setup in cases where
          gathering is not performed prior to initiating the call.</t>

          <t>JSEP supports optional candidate trickling by providing
          APIs, as described above, that provide control and feedback
          on the ICE candidate gathering process. Applications that
          support candidate trickling can send the initial offer
          immediately and send individual candidates when they get the
          notified of a new candidate; applications that do not support
          this feature can simply wait for the indication that
          gathering is complete, and then create and send their offer,
          with all the candidates, at this time.</t>

          <t>Upon receipt of trickled candidates, the receiving
          application will supply them to its ICE agent. This triggers
          the ICE agent to start using the new remote candidates for
          connectivity checks.</t>
          <section title="ICE Candidate Format"
          anchor="sec.ice-candidate-format">

            <t>In JSEP, ICE candidates are abstracted by an
            IceCandidate object, and as with session descriptions, SDP
            syntax is used for the internal representation.</t>

            <t>The candidate details are specified in an IceCandidate
            field, using the same SDP syntax as the
            "candidate-attribute" field defined in
            <xref target="RFC5245" />, Section 15.1. Note that this field
            does not contain an "a=" prefix, as indicated in
            the following example:</t>
            <figure>
              <artwork>
                <![CDATA[
candidate:1 1 UDP 1694498815 192.0.2.33 10000 typ host
]]>
</artwork>
            </figure>

            <t>The IceCandidate object contains a field to indicate
            which ICE ufrag it is associated with, as defined in
            <xref target="RFC5245" />, Section 15.4. This value is used
            to determine which session description (and thereby which
            gathering phase) this IceCandidate belongs to, which helps
            resolve ambiguities during ICE restarts. If this field is
            absent in a received IceCandidate (perhaps when
            communicating with a non-JSEP endpoint), the most recently
            received session description is assumed.</t>

            <t>The IceCandidate object also contains fields to indicate
            which m= section it is associated with, which can be
            identified in one of two ways, either by a m= section
            index, or a MID. The m= section index is a zero-based
            index, with index N referring to the N+1th m= section in
            the session description referenced by this IceCandidate.
            The MID is a "media stream identification" value, as
            defined in
            <xref target="RFC5888"></xref>, Section 4, which provides a
            more robust way to identify the m= section in the session
            description, using the MID of the associated RtpTransceiver
            object (which may have been locally generated by the
            answerer when interacting with a non-JSEP endpoint that
            does not support the MID attribute, as discussed in
            <xref target="sec.applying-a-remote-desc" /> below). If the
            MID field is present in a received IceCandidate, it MUST be
            used for identification; otherwise, the m= section index is
            used instead.</t>

            <t>When creating an IceCandidate object, JSEP
            implementations MUST populate all of these fields.</t>

        <section title="ICE Candidate Policy"
        anchor="sec.ice-candidate-policy">

          <t>Typically, when gathering ICE candidates, the JSEP
          implementation will gather all possible forms of initial
          candidates - host, server reflexive, and relay. However, in
          certain cases, applications may want to have more specific
          control over the gathering process, due to privacy or related
          concerns. For example, one may want to only use relay
          candidates, to leak as little location information as
          possible (keeping in mind that this choice comes with
          corresponding operational costs). To accomplish this, JSEP
          allows the application to restrict which ICE candidates are
          used in a session. Note that this filtering is applied on top
          of any restrictions the implementation chooses to enforce
          regarding which IP addresses are permitted for the
          application, as discussed in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-ip-handling" />.</t>

          <t>There may also be cases where the application wants to
          change which types of candidates are used while the session
          is active. A prime example is where a callee may initially
          want to use only relay candidates, to avoid leaking location
          information to an arbitrary caller, but then change to use
          all candidates (for lower operational cost) once the user has
          indicated they want to take the call. For this scenario, the
          JSEP implementation MUST allow the candidate policy to be
          changed in mid-session, subject to the aforementioned
          interactions with local policy.</t>

          <t>To administer the ICE candidate policy, the JSEP
          implementation will determine the current setting at the
          start of each gathering phase. Then, during the gathering
          phase, the implementation MUST NOT expose candidates
          disallowed by the current policy to the application, use them
          as the source of connectivity checks, or indirectly expose
          them via other fields, such as the raddr/rport attributes for
          other ICE candidates. Later, if a different policy is
          specified by the application, the application can apply it by
          kicking off a new gathering phase via an ICE restart.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="ICE Candidate Pool"
        anchor="sec.ice-candidate-pool">

          <t>JSEP applications typically inform the JSEP implementation
          to begin ICE gathering via the information supplied to
          setLocalDescription, as the local description indicates the
          number of ICE components which will be needed and for which
          candidates must be gathered. However, to accelerate cases
          where the application knows the number of ICE components to
          use ahead of time, it may ask the implementation to gather a
          pool of potential ICE candidates to help ensure rapid media
          setup.</t>

          <t>When setLocalDescription is eventually called, and the
          JSEP implementation goes to gather the needed ICE candidates,
          it SHOULD start by checking if any candidates are available
          in the pool. If there are candidates in the pool, they SHOULD
          be handed to the application immediately via the ICE
          candidate event. If the pool becomes depleted, either because
          a larger-than-expected number of ICE components is used, or
          because the pool has not had enough time to gather
          candidates, the remaining candidates are gathered as usual.
          This only occurs for the first offer/answer exchange, after
          which the candidate pool is emptied and no longer used.</t>

          <t>One example of where this concept is useful is an
          application that expects an incoming call at some point in
          the future, and wants to minimize the time it takes to
          establish connectivity, to avoid clipping of initial media.
          By pre-gathering candidates into the pool, it can exchange
          and start sending connectivity checks from these candidates
          almost immediately upon receipt of a call. Note though that
          by holding on to these pre-gathered candidates, which will be
          kept alive as long as they may be needed, the application
          will consume resources on the STUN/TURN servers it is
          using.</t>

      <section anchor="sec.imageattr" title="Video Size Negotiation">

        <t>Video size negotiation is the process through which a
        receiver can use the "a=imageattr" SDP attribute
        <xref target="RFC6236" /> to indicate what video frame sizes it
        is capable of receiving. A receiver may have hard limits on
        what its video decoder can process, or it may have some maximum
        set by policy. By specifying these limits in an "a=imageattr"
        attribute, JSEP endpoints can attempt to ensure that the remote
        sender transmits video at an acceptable resolution. However, when
        communicating with a non-JSEP endpoint that does not understand
        this attribute, any signaled limits may be exceeded, and the JSEP
        implementation MUST handle this gracefully, e.g., by discarding
        the video.</t>

        <t>Note that certain codecs support transmission of samples
        with aspect ratios other than 1.0 (i.e., non-square pixels).
        JSEP implementations will not transmit non-square pixels, but
        SHOULD receive and render such video with the correct aspect
        ratio. However, sample aspect ratio has no impact on the size
        negotiation described below; all dimensions are measured in
        pixels, whether square or not.</t>
        <section title="Creating an imageattr Attribute">

          <t>The receiver will first intersect any known local limits
          (e.g., hardware decoder capababilities, local policy) to
          determine the absolute minimum and maximum sizes it can
          receive. If there are no known local limits, the
          "a=imageattr" attribute SHOULD be omitted. If these local limits
          preclude receiving any video, i.e., the degenerate case of no
          permitted resolutions, the "a=imageattr" attribute MUST be omitted,
          and the m= section MUST be marked as sendonly/inactive, as
          appropriate.</t>

          <t>Otherwise, an "a=imageattr" attribute is created with
          "recv" direction, and the resulting resolution space formed
          from the aforementioned intersection is used to specify its
          minimum and maximum x= and y= values.</t>

          <t>The rules here express a single set of preferences, and
          therefore, the "a=imageattr" q= value is not important. It
          SHOULD be set to 1.0.</t>

          <t>The "a=imageattr" field is payload type specific. When all
          video codecs supported have the same capabilities, use of a
          single attribute, with the wildcard payload type (*), is
          RECOMMENDED. However, when the supported video codecs have
          different limitations, specific "a=imageattr" attributes MUST
          be inserted for each payload type.</t>

          <t>As an example, consider a system with a multiformat video
          decoder, which is capable of decoding any resolution from
          48x48 to 720p, In this case, the implementation would
          generate this attribute:</t>

          <t>a=imageattr:* recv [x=[48:1280],y=[48:720],q=1.0]</t>

          <t>This declaration indicates that the receiver is capable of
          decoding any image resolution from 48x48 up to 1280x720
          pixels.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Interpreting an imageattr Attribute">

          <t>
          <xref target="RFC6236" /> defines "a=imageattr" to be an
          advisory field. This means that it does not absolutely
          constrain the video formats that the sender can use, but
          gives an indication of the preferred values.</t>

          <t>This specification prescribes more specific behavior.
          When a MediaStreamTrack, which is producing
          video of a certain resolution (the "track resolution"), is attached
          to a RtpSender, which is encoding the track video
          at the same or lower resolution(s) (the "encoder resolutions"),
          and a remote description is applied that references the sender and
          contains valid "a=imageattr recv" attributes, it MUST
          follow the rules below to ensure the sender does not transmit a
          resolution that would exceed the size criteria specified in the
          attributes. These rules MUST be followed
          as long as the attributes remain present in the remote description,
          including cases in which the track changes its resolution,
          or is replaced with a different track.
          </t>

          <t>Depending on how the RtpSender is configured, it may be producing
          a single encoding at a certain resolution, or, if
          simulcast <xref target="sec.simulcast" /> has been negotiated,
          multiple encodings, each at their own specific resolution. In
          addition, depending on the configuration, each encoding may have the
          flexibility to reduce resolution when needed, or may be locked to
          a specific output resolution.
          </t>

          <t>For each encoding being produced by the RtpSender, the following
          rules are applied to determine what should be transmitted:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>First, the most suitable "a=imageattr recv" attribute is
              selected. This is performed by taking the
              attribute with the highest "q=" value from the set of attributes
              that reference the media format that has been selected for the
              specified encoding. If multiple attributes have the same "q="
              value, the one that appears first in the m= section is used.
              Note that while JSEP endpoints will include at most
              one "a=imageattr recv" attribute per media format, JSEP
              endpoints may receive session descriptions from non-JSEP
              endpoints with m= sections that contain multiple such attributes.
              </t>

              <t>If there is an applicable "a=imageattr recv" attribute for
              the encoding, the limits from the attribute are then compared to
              the encoder resolution. Only the specific limits mentioned below
              are considered; any other values, such as picture aspect ratio,
              MUST be ignored.
              Note that when considering a MediaStreamTrack that is producing
              rotated video, the unrotated resolution MUST be used for the
              checks. This is
              required regardless of whether the receiver supports
              performing receive-side rotation (e.g., through CVO
              <xref target="TS26.114" />), as it significantly simplifies
              the matching logic.</t>

              <t>If the attribute includes a "sar=" (sample aspect ratio)
              value set to something other than "1.0", indicating the
              receiver wants to receive non-square pixels, this cannot be
              satisfied and the sender MUST NOT transmit the encoding.</t>

              <t>If the encoder resolution exceeds the maximum size permitted by the
              attribute, and the encoder is allowed to adjust its resolution,
              the encoder SHOULD apply downscaling in order to satisfy the limits,
              although the downscaling MUST NOT change the picture aspect ratio
              of the encoding. For example, if the encoder resolution is
              1280x720, and the attribute specified a maximum of 640x480, the
              expected output resolution would be 640x360.
              If downscaling cannot be applied, the encoding MUST NOT be
              transmitted, and an error SHOULD be surfaced to the application.</t>

              <t>If the encoder resolution is less than the minimum size permitted
              by the attribute, the encoding MUST NOT be transmitted, and an
              error SHOULD be surfaced to the application; the encoder
              MUST NOT apply upscaling. JSEP implementations SHOULD avoid this
              situation by allowing receipt of arbitrarily small resolutions,
              perhaps via fallback to a software decoder.</t>

      <section title="Simulcast" anchor="sec.simulcast">

        <t>JSEP supports simulcast transmission of a MediaStreamTrack,
        where multiple encodings of the source media can be transmitted
        within the context of a single m= section. The current JSEP API
        is designed to allow applications to send simulcasted media but
        only to receive a single encoding. This allows for multi-user
        scenarios where each sending client sends multiple encodings to
        a server, which then, for each receiving client, chooses the
        appropriate encoding to forward.</t>

        <t>Applications request support for simulcast by configuring
        multiple encodings on an RtpSender, which, upon generation of
        an offer or answer, are indicated in SDP markings on the
        corresponding m= section, as described below. Receivers that
        understand simulcast and are willing to receive it will also
        include SDP markings to indicate their support, and JSEP
        endpoints will use these markings to determine whether
        simulcast is permitted for a given RtpSender. If simulcast
        support is not negotiated, the RtpSender will only use the
        first configured encoding.</t>

        <t>Note that the exact simulcast parameters are up to the
        sending application. While the aforementioned SDP markings are
        provided to ensure the remote side can receive and demux
        multiple simulcast encodings, the specific resolutions and
        bitrates to be used for each encoding are purely a send-side
        decision in JSEP.</t>

        <t>JSEP currently does not provide a mechanism to configure
        receipt of simulcast. This means that if simulcast is offered
        by the remote endpoint, the answer generated by a JSEP endpoint
        will not indicate support for receipt of simulcast, and as such
        the remote endpoint will only send a single encoding per m=
        section.</t>

        <t>In addition, JSEP does not provide a mechanism to handle an
        incoming offer requesting simulcast from the JSEP endpoint.
        This means that established simulcast streams will continue to
        work through a received re-offer, but setting up initial
        simulcast by way of a received offer requires out-of-band
        signaling or SDP inspection. Future versions of this
        specification may add additional APIs to provide direct
        control.</t>

        <t>When using JSEP to transmit multiple encodings from a
        RtpSender, the techniques from
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-simulcast" /> and
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-rid" /> are used. Specifically,
        when multiple encodings have been configured for a RtpSender,
        the m= section for the RtpSender will include an "a=simulcast"
        attribute, as defined in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-simulcast" />, Section 6.2,
        with a "send" simulcast stream description that lists each
        desired encoding, and no "recv" simulcast stream description.
        The m= section will also include an "a=rid" attribute for each
        encoding, as specified in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-rid" />, Section 4; the use of
        RID identifiers allows the individual encodings to be
        disambiguated even though they are all part of the same m=
        section.</t>

      <section title="Interactions With Forking"
      anchor="sec.interactions-with-forking">

        <t>Some call signaling systems allow various types of forking
        where an SDP Offer may be provided to more than one device. For
        example, SIP
        <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> defines both a "Parallel Search"
        and "Sequential Search". Although these are primarily signaling
        level issues that are outside the scope of JSEP, they do have
        some impact on the configuration of the media plane that is
        relevant. When forking happens at the signaling layer, the
        JavaScript application responsible for the signaling needs to
        make the decisions about what media should be sent or received
        at any point of time, as well as which remote endpoint it
        should communicate with; JSEP is used to make sure the media
        engine can make the RTP and media perform as required by the
        application. The basic operations that the applications can
        have the media engine do are:
        <list style="symbols">

          <t>Start exchanging media with a given remote peer, but keep
          all the resources reserved in the offer.</t>

          <t>Start exchanging media with a given remote peer, and free
          any resources in the offer that are not being used.</t>
        </list></t>
        <section title="Sequential Forking"
        anchor="sec.sequential-forking">

          <t>Sequential forking involves a call being dispatched to
          multiple remote callees, where each callee can accept the
          call, but only one active session ever exists at a time; no
          mixing of received media is performed.</t>

          <t>JSEP handles sequential forking well, allowing the
          application to easily control the policy for selecting the
          desired remote endpoint. When an answer arrives from one of
          the callees, the application can choose to apply it either as
          a provisional answer, leaving open the possibility of using a
          different answer in the future, or apply it as a final
          answer, ending the setup flow.</t>

          <t>In a "first-one-wins" situation, the first answer will be
          applied as a final answer, and the application will reject
          any subsequent answers. In SIP parlance, this would be ACK +
          BYE.</t>

          <t>In a "last-one-wins" situation, all answers would be
          applied as provisional answers, and any previous call leg
          will be terminated. At some point, the application will end
          the setup process, perhaps with a timer; at this point, the
          application could reapply the pending remote description as a
          final answer.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Parallel Forking"
        anchor="sec.parallel-forking">

          <t>Parallel forking involves a call being dispatched to
          multiple remote callees, where each callee can accept the
          call, and multiple simultaneous active signaling sessions can
          be established as a result. If multiple callees send media at
          the same time, the possibilities for handling this are
          described in
          <xref target="RFC3960"></xref>, Section 3.1.
          Most SIP devices today only
          support exchanging media with a single device at a time, and
          do not try to mix multiple early media audio sources, as that
          could result in a confusing situation. For example, consider
          having a European ringback tone mixed together with the North
          American ringback tone - the resulting sound would not be
          like either tone, and would confuse the user. If the
          signaling application wishes to only exchange media with one
          of the remote endpoints at a time, then from a media engine
          point of view, this is exactly like the sequential forking
          case.</t>

          <t>In the parallel forking case where the JavaScript
          application wishes to simultaneously exchange media with
          multiple peers, the flow is slightly more complex, but the
          JavaScript application can follow the strategy that
          <xref target="RFC3960"></xref> describes using UPDATE. The
          UPDATE approach allows the signaling to set up a separate
          media flow for each peer that it wishes to exchange media
          with. In JSEP, this offer used in the UPDATE would be formed
          by simply creating a new PeerConnection and making sure that
          the same local media streams have been added into this new
          PeerConnection. Then the new PeerConnection object would
          produce a SDP offer that could be used by the signaling to
          perform the UPDATE strategy discussed in
          <xref target="RFC3960"></xref>.</t>

          <t>As a result of sharing the media streams, the application
          will end up with N parallel PeerConnection sessions, each
          with a local and remote description and their own local and
          remote addresses. The media flow from these sessions can be
          managed using setDirection (see
          <xref target="sec.transceiver-set-direction" />), or the
          application can choose to play out the media from all
          sessions mixed together. Of course, if the application wants
          to only keep a single session, it can simply terminate the
          sessions that it no longer needs.</t>

    <section title="Interface" anchor="sec.interface">

      <t>This section details the basic operations that must be present
      to implement JSEP functionality. The actual API exposed in the
      W3C API may have somewhat different syntax, but should map easily
      to these concepts.</t>
      <section title="PeerConnection" anchor="sec.peerconnection">
        <section title="Constructor" anchor="sec.pc-constructor">

          <t>The PeerConnection constructor allows the application to
          specify global parameters for the media session, such as the
          STUN/TURN servers and credentials to use when gathering
          candidates, as well as the initial ICE candidate policy and
          pool size, and also the bundle policy to use.</t>

          <t>If an ICE candidate policy is specified, it functions as
          described in
          <xref target="sec.ice-candidate-policy" />, causing the JSEP
          implementation to only surface the permitted candidates
          (including any implementation-internal filtering) to the
          application, and only use those candidates for connectivity
          checks. The set of available policies is as follows:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="all:">All candidates permitted by
            implementation policy will be gathered and used.</t>

            <t></t>
            <t hangText="relay:">All candidates except relay candidates
            will be filtered out. This obfuscates the location
            information that might be ascertained by the remote peer
            from the received candidates. Depending on how the
            application deploys and chooses relay servers, this could
            obfuscate location to a metro or possibly even global
            level.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>The default ICE candidate policy MUST be set to "all" as
          this is generally the desired policy, and also typically
          reduces use of application TURN server resources
          significantly.</t>

          <t>If a size is specified for the ICE candidate pool, this
          indicates the number of ICE components to pre-gather
          candidates for. Because pre-gathering results in utilizing
          STUN/TURN server resources for potentially long periods of
          time, this must only occur upon application request, and
          therefore the default candidate pool size MUST be zero.</t>

          <t>The application can specify its preferred policy regarding
          use of bundle, the multiplexing mechanism defined in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation">
          </xref>. Regardless of policy, the application will always
          try to negotiate bundle onto a single transport, and will
          offer a single bundle group across all m= sections; use of
          this single transport is contingent upon the answerer
          accepting bundle. However, by specifying a policy from the
          list below, the application can control exactly how
          aggressively it will try to bundle media streams together,
          which affects how it will interoperate with a
          non-bundle-aware endpoint. When negotiating with a
          non-bundle-aware endpoint, only the streams not marked as
          bundle-only streams will be established.</t>

          <t>The set of available policies is as follows:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="balanced:">The first m= section of each type
            (audio, video, or application) will contain transport
            parameters, which will allow an answerer to unbundle that
            section. The second and any subsequent m= section of each
            type will be marked bundle-only. The result is that if
            there are N distinct media types, then candidates will be
            gathered for for N media streams. This policy balances
            desire to multiplex with the need to ensure basic audio and
            video can still be negotiated in legacy cases. When acting
            as answerer, if there is no bundle group in the offer, the
            implementation will reject all but the first m= section of
            each type.</t>

            <t></t>
            <t hangText="max-compat:">All m= sections will contain
            transport parameters; none will be marked as bundle-only.
            This policy will allow all streams to be received by
            non-bundle-aware endpoints, but require separate candidates
            to be gathered for each media stream.</t>

            <t></t>
            <t hangText="max-bundle:">Only the first m= section will
            contain transport parameters; all streams other than the
            first will be marked as bundle-only. This policy aims to
            minimize candidate gathering and maximize multiplexing, at
            the cost of less compatibility with legacy endpoints. When
            acting as answerer, the implementation will reject any m=
            sections other than the first m= section, unless they are
            in the same bundle group as that m= section.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>As it provides the best tradeoff between performance and
          compatibility with legacy endpoints, the default bundle
          policy MUST be set to "balanced".</t>

          <t>The application can specify its preferred policy regarding
          use of RTP/RTCP multiplexing
          <xref target="RFC5761"></xref> using one of the following

          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="negotiate:">The JSEP implementation will
            gather both RTP and RTCP candidates but also will offer

            <t hangText="require:">The JSEP implementation will only

            indication into any new m= sections in offers it generates.
            This halves the number of candidates that the offerer needs
            to gather. Applying a description with an m= section that
            does not contain an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute will cause an

          createOffer should return an offer that reflects the current
          state of the system, so that setLocalDescription will succeed
          when it attempts to acquire those resources.</t>

          <t>Calling this method may do things such as generating new
          ICE credentials, but does not result in candidate gathering,
          or cause media to start or stop flowing. Specifically, the
          offer is not applied, and does not become the pending local
          description, until setLocalDescription is called.</t>

          configuration for the session that is compatible with the
          parameters supplied in the most recent call to
          setRemoteDescription, which MUST have been called prior to
          calling createAnswer. Like createOffer, the returned blob
          contains descriptions of the media added to this
          PeerConnection, the codec/RTP/RTCP options negotiated for
          this session, and any candidates that have been gathered by

          provide additional control over the generated answer.</t>

          <t>As an answer, the generated SDP will contain a specific
          configuration that specifies how the media plane should be

        <section title="SessionDescriptionType"
        anchor="sec.sessiondescriptiontype">

          <t>Session description objects (RTCSessionDescription) may be
          of type "offer", "pranswer", "answer" or "rollback". These
          types provide information as to how the description parameter
          should be parsed, and how the media state should be
          changed.</t>

          <t>"offer" indicates that a description should be parsed as
          an offer; said description may include many possible media
          configurations. A description used as an "offer" may be
          applied anytime the PeerConnection is in a stable state, or
          as an update to a previously supplied but unanswered
          "offer".</t>

          <t>"pranswer" indicates that a description should be parsed
          as an answer, but not a final answer, and so should not
          result in the freeing of allocated resources. It may result
          in the start of media transmission, if the answer does not
          specify an inactive media direction. A description used as a
          "pranswer" may be applied as a response to an "offer", or an
          update to a previously sent "pranswer".</t>

          <t>"answer" indicates that a description should be parsed as
          an answer, the offer-answer exchange should be considered
          complete, and any resources (decoders, candidates) that are
          no longer needed can be released. A description used as an
          "answer" may be applied as a response to an "offer", or an
          update to a previously sent "pranswer".</t>

          <t>The only difference between a provisional and final answer
          is that the final answer results in the freeing of any unused
          resources that were allocated as a result of the offer. As
          such, the application can use some discretion on whether an
          answer should be applied as provisional or final, and can
          change the type of the session description as needed. For
          example, in a serial forking scenario, an application may
          receive multiple "final" answers, one from each remote
          endpoint. The application could choose to accept the initial
          answers as provisional answers, and only apply an answer as
          final when it receives one that meets its criteria (e.g. a
          live user instead of voicemail).</t>

          <t>"rollback" is a special session description type implying
          that the state machine should be rolled back to the previous
          stable state, as described in
          <xref target="sec.rollback" />. The contents MUST be
          empty.</t>
          <section title="Use of Provisional Answers"
          anchor="sec.use-of-provisional-answer">

            <t>Most applications will not need to create answers using
            the "pranswer" type. While it is good practice to send an
            immediate response to an offer, in order to warm up the
            session transport and prevent media clipping, the preferred
            handling for a JSEP application is to create and send a
            "sendonly" final answer with a null MediaStreamTrack
            immediately after receiving the offer, which will prevent
            media from being sent by the caller, and allow media to be
            sent immediately upon answer by the callee. Later, when the
            callee actually accepts the call, the application can plug
            in the real MediaStreamTrack and create a new "sendrecv"
            offer to update the previous offer/answer pair and start
            bidirectional media flow. While this could also be done
            with a "sendonly" pranswer, followed by a "sendrecv"
            answer, the initial pranswer leaves the offer-answer
            exchange open, which means that the caller cannot send an
            updated offer during this time.</t>

            <t>As an example, consider a typical JSEP application that
            wants to set up audio and video as quickly as possible.
            When the callee receives an offer with audio and video
            MediaStreamTracks, it will send an immediate answer
            accepting these tracks as sendonly (meaning that the caller
            will not send the callee any media yet, and because the
            callee has not yet added its own MediaStreamTracks, the
            callee will not send any media either). It will then ask
            the user to accept the call and acquire the needed local
            tracks. Upon acceptance by the user, the application will
            plug in the tracks it has acquired, which, because ICE and
            DTLS handshaking have likely completed by this point, can
            start transmitting immediately. The application will also
            send a new offer to the remote side indicating call
            acceptance and moving the audio and video to be two-way
            media. A detailed example flow along these lines is shown
            in
            <xref target="sec.warmup-example"></xref>.</t>

            <t>Of course, some applications may not be able to perform
            this double offer-answer exchange, particularly ones that
            are attempting to gateway to legacy signaling protocols. In
            these cases, pranswer can still provide the application
            with a mechanism to warm up the transport.</t>
          </section>
          <section title="Rollback" anchor="sec.rollback">

            <t>In certain situations it may be desirable to "undo" a
            change made to setLocalDescription or setRemoteDescription.
            Consider a case where a call is ongoing, and one side wants
            to change some of the session parameters; that side
            generates an updated offer and then calls
            setLocalDescription. However, the remote side, either
            before or after setRemoteDescription, decides it does not
            want to accept the new parameters, and sends a reject
            message back to the offerer. Now, the offerer, and possibly
            the answerer as well, need to return to a stable state and
            the previous local/remote description. To support this, we
            introduce the concept of "rollback".</t>

            <t>A rollback discards any proposed changes to the session,
            returning the state machine to the stable state, and
            setting the pending local and/or remote description (see
            <xref target="sec.pendinglocaldescription" /> and
            <xref target="sec.pendingremotedescription" />) to null.
            Any resources or candidates that were allocated by the
            abandoned local description are discarded; any media that
            is received will be processed according to the previous
            local and remote descriptions. Rollback can only be used to
            cancel proposed changes; there is no support for rolling
            back from a stable state to a previous stable state. Note
            that this implies that once the answerer has performed
            setLocalDescription with his answer, this cannot be rolled
            back.</t>

            <t>A rollback will disassociate any RtpTransceivers that
            were associated with m= sections by the application of the
            rolled-back session description (see
            <xref target="sec.applying-a-remote-desc" /> and
            <xref target="sec.applying-a-local-desc" />). This means
            that some RtpTransceivers that were previously associated
            will no longer be associated with any m= section; in such
            cases, the value of the RtpTransceiver's mid property MUST
            be set to null, and the mapping between the transceiver and
            its m= section index MUST be discarded. RtpTransceivers
            that were created by applying a remote offer that was
            subsequently rolled back MUST be stopped and removed from
            the PeerConnection. However, a RtpTransceiver MUST NOT be
            removed if a track was attached to the RtpTransceiver via
            the addTrack method. This is so that an application may
            call addTrack, then call setRemoteDescription with an
            offer, then roll back that offer, then call createOffer and
            have a m= section for the added track appear in the
            generated offer.</t>

            <t>A rollback is performed by supplying a session
            description of type "rollback" with empty contents to
            either setLocalDescription or setRemoteDescription,
            depending on which was most recently used (i.e. if the new
            offer was supplied to setLocalDescription, the rollback
            should be done using setLocalDescription as well).</t>

        <section title="setLocalDescription"
        anchor="sec.setlocaldescription">

          <t>The setLocalDescription method instructs the
          PeerConnection to apply the supplied session description as
          its local configuration. The type field indicates whether the
          description should be processed as an offer, provisional
          answer, final answer, or rollback; offers and answers are checked
          differently, using the various rules that exist for each SDP
          line.</t>

          <t>This API changes the local media state; among other
          things, it sets up local resources for receiving and decoding
          media. In order to successfully handle scenarios where the
          application wants to offer to change from one media format to
          a different, incompatible format, the PeerConnection must be
          able to simultaneously support use of both the current and
          pending local descriptions (e.g., support the codecs that
          exist in either description). This dual processing begins
          when the PeerConnection enters the "have-local-offer" state,
          and continues until setRemoteDescription is called with
          either a final answer, at which point the PeerConnection can
          fully adopt the pending local description, or a rollback,
          which results in a revert to the current local
          description.</t>

          <t>This API indirectly controls the candidate gathering
          process. When a local description is supplied, and the number
          of transports currently in use does not match the number of
          transports needed by the local description, the
          PeerConnection will create transports as needed and begin
          gathering candidates for each transport, using ones from the
          candidate pool if available.</t>

          <t>If setRemoteDescription was previously called with an
          offer, and setLocalDescription is called with an answer
          (provisional or final), and the media directions are

              <t>Any changes to the STUN/TURN servers to use affect the

              mentioned in

              restart and kicking off a new gathering phase, in which
              the new servers will be used. If the ICE candidate pool

          <xref target="I-D.ietf-ice-trickle" />). The MID and ufrag
          are used as described above to determine the m= section and
          ICE generation for which candidate gathering is complete. If
          the ufrag is not present, then the end-of-candidates
          indication MUST be assumed to apply to the relevant m=
          section in the most recently applied remote description. If
          neither the MID nor the m= index is present, then the
          indication MUST be assumed to apply to all m= sections in the
          most recently applied remote description.</t>

          <t>This call will result in a change to the state of the ICE
          Agent, and may result in a change to media state if it
          results in connectivity being established.</t>

          associated m= section on future calls to createOffer and
          createAnswer.</t>

          <t>When creating offers, the transceiver direction is
          directly reflected in the output, even for re-offers. When
          creating answers, the transceiver direction is intersected
          with the offered direction, as explained in

          <t>Note that while setDirection sets the direction property
          of the transceiver immediately
          (<xref target="sec.transceiver-direction" />), this property
          does not immediately affect whether the transceiver's
          RtpSender will send or its RtpReceiver will receive. The
          direction in effect is represented by the currentDirection
          property, which is only updated when an answer is

          createOffer and createAnswer. Note that setCodecPreferences
          does not directly affect which codec the implementation
          decides to send. It only affects which codecs the
          implementation indicates that it prefers to receive, via the
          offer or answer. Even when a codec is excluded by
          setCodecPreferences, it still may be used to send until the
          next offer/answer exchange discards it.</t>

          <t>The codec preferences of an RtpTransceiver can cause
          codecs to be excluded by subsequent calls to createOffer and

          <t>The codec preferences of an RtpTransceiver can also
          determine the order of codecs in subsequent calls to

        <section title="Profile Names and Interoperability"
        anchor="sec.profile-names">

          <t>For media m= sections, JSEP implementations MUST support
          the "UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF" profile specified in
          <xref target="RFC7850"></xref>, and MUST indicate this
          profile for each media m= line they produce in an offer. For
          data m= sections, implementations MUST support the
          "UDP/DTLS/SCTP" profile and MUST indicate this profile for
          each data m= line they produce in an offer. Because ICE can
          select either UDP
          <xref target="RFC5245" /> or TCP
          <xref target='RFC6544' /> transport depending on network
          conditions, this advertisement is consistent with ICE
          eventually selecting either either UDP or TCP.</t>

          <t>Unfortunately, in an attempt at compatibility, some
          endpoints generate other profile strings even when they mean
          to support one of these profiles. For instance, an endpoint
          might generate "RTP/AVP" but supply "a=fingerprint" and
          "a=rtcp-fb" attributes, indicating its willingness to support
          "UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF" or "TCP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF". In order to simplify compatibility
          with such endpoints, JSEP implementations MUST follow the
          following rules when processing the media m= sections in a
          received offer:</t>

          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Any profile in the offer matching one of the following
              MUST be accepted:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>"RTP/AVP" (Defined in <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 8.2.2)</t>
                <t>"RTP/AVPF" (Defined in <xref target="RFC4585"></xref>, Section 9)</t>

              <t>The profile in any "m=" line in any generated answer
              MUST exactly match the profile provided in the offer.
              </t>

              <t>Because DTLS-SRTP is REQUIRED, the choice of SAVP or
              AVP has no effect; support for DTLS-SRTP is determined by
              the presence of one or more "a=fingerprint" attribute.
              Note that lack of an "a=fingerprint" attribute will lead
              to negotiation failure.</t>

              <t>The use of AVPF or AVP simply controls the timing
              rules used for RTCP feedback. If AVPF is provided, or an
              "a=rtcp-fb" attribute is present, assume AVPF timing,
              i.e., a default value of "trr-int=0". Otherwise, assume
              that AVPF is being used in an AVP compatible mode and use
              a value of "trr-int=4000".</t>

              <t>For data m= sections, implementations MUST support
              receiving the "UDP/DTLS/SCTP", "TCP/DTLS/SCTP", or
              "DTLS/SCTP" (for backwards compatibility) profiles.</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Note that re-offers by JSEP implementations MUST use the
          correct profile strings even if the initial offer/answer
          exchange used an (incorrect) older profile string.</t>

      <section anchor="sec-create-offer" title="Constructing an Offer">

        <t>When createOffer is called, a new SDP description must be
        created that includes the functionality specified in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage"></xref>. The exact
        details of this process are explained below.</t>
        <section title="Initial Offers" anchor="sec.initial-offers">

          <t>When createOffer is called for the first time, the result
          is known as the initial offer.</t>

          <t>The first step in generating an initial offer is to
          generate session-level attributes, as specified in
          <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 5. Specifically:
          <list style="symbols">

            <t>The first SDP line MUST be "v=0", as specified in
            <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 5.1</t>

            <t>The second SDP line MUST be an "o=" line, as specified
            in
            <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 5.2. The value of
            the &lt;username&gt; field SHOULD be "-".
            <xref target="RFC3264" /> requires that the &lt;sess-id&gt;
            be representable as a 64-bit signed integer. It is
            RECOMMENDED that the &lt;sess-id&gt; be generated as a
            64-bit quantity with the high bit being sent to zero and
            the remaining 63 bits being cryptographically random. The
            value of the &lt;nettype&gt; &lt;addrtype&gt;
            &lt;unicast-address&gt; tuple SHOULD be set to a
            non-meaningful address, such as IN IP4 0.0.0.0, to prevent
            leaking the local address in this field. As mentioned in
            <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>, the entire o= line needs to
            be unique, but selecting a random number for
            &lt;sess-id&gt; is sufficient to accomplish this.</t>

            <t>The third SDP line MUST be a "s=" line, as specified in
            <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 5.3; to match the
            "o=" line, a single dash SHOULD be used as the session
            name, e.g. "s=-". Note that this differs from the advice in

            <xref target="RFC4566" /> which proposes a single space, but
            as both "o=" and "s=" are meaningless in JSEP, having the same
            meaningless value seems clearer.</t>

            <t>Session Information ("i="), URI ("u="), Email Address
            ("e="), Phone Number ("p="), Repeat Times ("r="), and Time
            Zones ("z=") lines are not useful in this context and
            SHOULD NOT be included.</t>

            <t>Encryption Keys ("k=") lines do not provide sufficient
            security and MUST NOT be included.</t>

            <t>A "t=" line MUST be added, as specified in
            <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 5.9; both
            &lt;start-time&gt; and &lt;stop-time&gt; SHOULD be set to
            zero, e.g. "t=0 0".</t>

            <t>An "a=ice-options" line with the "trickle" option MUST
            be added, as specified in
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-ice-trickle"></xref>, Section 4.</t>

            <t>If WebRTC identity is being used, an "a=identity" line

            5.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>The next step is to generate m= sections, as specified in
          <xref target="RFC4566" />, Section 5.14. An m= section is
          generated for each RtpTransceiver that has been added to the
          PeerConnection, excluding any stopped RtpTransceivers. This
          is done in the order the RtpTransceivers were added to the
          PeerConnection.</t>

          <t>For each m= section generated for an RtpTransceiver,
          establish a mapping between the transceiver and the index of
          the generated m= section.</t>

          <t>Each m= section, provided it is not marked as bundle-only,
          MUST generate a unique set of ICE credentials and gather its
          own unique set of ICE candidates. Bundle-only m= sections
          MUST NOT contain any ICE credentials and MUST NOT gather any
          candidates.</t>

          <t>For DTLS, all m= sections MUST use all the certificate(s)
          that have been specified for the PeerConnection; as a result,
          they MUST all have the same
          <xref target="RFC8122"></xref> fingerprint
          value(s), or these value(s) MUST be session-level
          attributes.</t>

          <t>Each m= section should be generated as specified in
          <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 5.14. For the m= line
          itself, the following rules MUST be followed:
          <list style="symbols">

            <t>If the m= section is marked as bundle-only, then
            the port value MUST be set to 0. Otherwise,

            candidate for this m= section, but given that no candidates
            are available yet, the "dummy" port value of 9 (Discard)
            MUST be used, as indicated in
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-ice-trickle"></xref>, Section
            5.1.</t>

            <t>To properly indicate use of DTLS, the &lt;proto&gt;
            field MUST be set to "UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF", as specified in
            <xref target="RFC5764" />, Section 8.</t>

            <t>If codec preferences have been set for the associated
            transceiver, media formats MUST be generated in the
            corresponding order, and MUST exclude any codecs not
            present in the codec preferences.</t>

            <t>Unless excluded by the above restrictions, the media
            formats MUST include the mandatory audio/video codecs as

            and <xref target="RFC7742"></xref>, Section 5.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>The m= line MUST be followed immediately by a "c=" line,
          as specified in
          <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 5.7. Again, as no
          candidates are available yet, the "c=" line must contain the
          "dummy" value "IN IP4 0.0.0.0", as defined in

          <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes" /> groups

          To avoid unnecessary duplication when bundling, attributes

          <t>Lastly, if a data channel has been created, a m= section

          <t>Within the data m= section, an "a=mid" line MUST be
          generated and included as described above, along with an
          "a=sctp-port" line referencing the SCTP port number, as
          defined in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp"></xref>, Section 5.1,
          and, if appropriate, an "a=max-message-size" line, as defined
          in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp"></xref>, Section
          6.1.</t>

          <t>As discussed above, the following attributes of category
          IDENTICAL or TRANSPORT are included only if the data m=
          section either has a unique address or is associated with the
          bundle-tag (e.g., if it is the only m= section):
          <list style="symbols">

            <t>"a=setup"</t>

            <t>"a=tls-id"</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>Once all m= sections have been generated, a session-level
          "a=group" attribute MUST be added as specified in
          <xref target="RFC5888"></xref>. This attribute MUST have
          semantics "BUNDLE", and MUST include the mid identifiers of
          each m= section. The effect of this is that the JSEP
          implementation offers all m= sections as one bundle group.
          However, whether the m= sections are bundle-only or not
          depends on the bundle policy.</t>

          <t>The next step is to generate session-level lip sync groups
          as defined in
          <xref target="RFC5888" />, Section 7. For each MediaStream
          referenced by more than one RtpTransceiver (by passing those
          MediaStreams as arguments to the addTrack and addTransceiver
          methods), a group of type "LS" MUST be added that contains
          the mid values for each RtpTransceiver.</t>

          <t>Attributes which SDP permits to either be at the session
          level or the media level SHOULD generally be at the media
          level even if they are identical. This assists development
          and debugging by making it easier to understand individual
          media sections, especially if one of a set of initially identical
          attributes is subsequently changed. However, implementations MAY
          choose to aggregate attributes at the session level and JSEP
          implementations MUST be prepared to receive attributes
          in either location.</t>

          <t>Attributes other than the ones specified above MAY be
          included, except for the following attributes which are
          specifically incompatible with the requirements of
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage"></xref>, and MUST
          NOT be included:
          <list style="symbols">

            <t>"a=crypto"</t>

            <t>"a=key-mgmt"</t>

            <t>"a=ice-lite"</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>Note that when bundle is used, any additional attributes
          that are added MUST follow the advice in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes"></xref> on
          how those attributes interact with bundle.</t>

          <t>Note that these requirements are in some cases stricter
          than those of SDP. Implementations MUST be prepared to accept
          compliant SDP even if it would not conform to the
          requirements for generating SDP in this specification.</t>

          <t>When createOffer is called a second (or later) time, or is
          called after a local description has already been installed,
          the processing is somewhat different than for an initial
          offer.</t>

          <t>If the previous offer was not applied using
          setLocalDescription, meaning the PeerConnection is still in
          the "stable" state, the steps for generating an initial offer
          should be followed, subject to the following restriction:
          <list style="symbols">

            <t>The fields of the "o=" line MUST stay the same except
            for the &lt;session-version&gt; field, which MUST increment
            by one on each call to createOffer if the offer might
            differ from the output of the previous call to createOffer;
            implementations MAY opt to increment
            &lt;session-version&gt; on every call. The value of the
            generated &lt;session-version&gt; is independent of the
            &lt;session-version&gt; of the current local description;
            in particular, in the case where the current version is N,
            an offer is created and applied with version N+1, and then
            that offer is rolled back so that the current version is
            again N, the next generated offer will still have version
            N+2.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>Note that if the application creates an offer by reading
          currentLocalDescription instead of calling createOffer, the
          returned SDP may be different than when setLocalDescription
          was originally called, due to the addition of gathered ICE
          candidates, but the &lt;session-version&gt; will not have
          changed. There are no known scenarios in which this causes
          problems, but if this is a concern, the solution is simply to
          use createOffer to ensure a unique
          &lt;session-version&gt;.</t>

          <t>If the previous offer was applied using
          setLocalDescription, but a corresponding answer from the remote side
          has not yet been applied, meaning the PeerConnection is still in

            added to the session description (including a new MID value),
            and placing it at the same index as the m= section with a zero

            <xref target="RFC5245" />, Section 9.1.2.2, which only
            refers to offers created when ICE has completed. In each

            indicated in
            <xref target="RFC5761"></xref>, Section 5.1.3. If no RTCP

            MUST include all currently available formats. Media formats that
            were previously offered but are no longer available (e.g., a
            shared hardware codec) MAY be excluded.</t>

            <t>Unless codec preferences have been set for the associated
            transceiver, the media formats on the m= line MUST be generated in
            the same order as in the most recent answer. Any media
            formats that were not present in the most recent answer MUST be
            added after all existing formats.</t>

            <t>The RTCP feedback mechanisms MUST only include those
            that are present in the most recent answer, except for the
            case of format-specific mechanisms that are referencing a
            newly-added media format.</t>

            <t>The "a=rtcp" line MUST NOT be added if the most recent
            answer included an "a=rtcp-mux" line.</t>

            <t>The "a=rtcp-mux" line MUST be the same as that in the most
            recent answer.</t>

            <t>The "a=rtcp-mux-only" line MUST NOT be added.</t>

            <t>The "a=rtcp-rsize" line MUST NOT be added unless present in
            the most recent answer.</t>

            <t>An "a=bundle-only" line MUST NOT be added, as indicated
            in
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation" />,
            Section 6. Instead, JSEP implementations MUST simply omit
            parameters in the IDENTICAL and TRANSPORT categories for
            bundled m= sections, as described in
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation" />,
            Section 8.1.</t>

            <t>Note that if media m= sections are bundled into a data
            m= section, then certain TRANSPORT and IDENTICAL attributes
            may appear in the data m= section even if they would
            otherwise only be appropriate for a media m= section (e.g.,
            "a=rtcp-mux"). This cannot happen in initial offers because
            in the initial offer JSEP implementations always list media
            m= sections (if any) before the data m= section (if any),
            and at least one of those media m= sections will not have
            the "a=bundle-only" attribute. Therefore, in initial
            offers, any "a=bundle-only" m= sections will be bundled
            into a preceding non-bundle-only media m= section.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>The "a=group:BUNDLE" attribute MUST include the MID
          identifiers specified in the bundle group in the most recent
          answer, minus any m= sections that have been marked as
          rejected, plus any newly added or re-enabled m= sections. In
          other words, the bundle attribute must contain all m=
          sections that were previously bundled, as long as they are
          still alive, as well as any new m= sections.</t>

          <t>"a=group:LS" attributes are generated in the same way as
          for initial offers, with the additional stipulation that any
          lip sync groups that were present in the most recent answer
          MUST continue to exist and MUST contain any previously
          existing MID identifiers, as long as the identified m=
          sections still exist and are not rejected, and the group
          still contains at least two MID identifiers. This ensures
          that any synchronized "recvonly" m= sections continue to be
          synchronized in the new offer.</t>

          <section title="IceRestart" anchor="sec.icerestart">

            <t>If the "IceRestart" option is specified, with a value of

            generating new ICE ufrag and pwd attributes, as specified
            in
            <xref target="RFC5245"></xref>, Section 9.1.1.1. If this
            option is specified on an initial offer, it has no effect
            (since a new ICE ufrag and pwd are already generated).
            Similarly, if the ICE configuration has changed, this
            option has no effect, since new ufrag and pwd attributes
            will be generated automatically. This option is primarily
            useful for reestablishing connectivity in cases where
            failures are detected by the application.</t>

            <t>Silence suppression, also known as discontinuous transmission
            ("DTX"), can reduce the bandwidth used for audio by switching to
            a special encoding when voice activity is not detected, at the cost
            of some fidelity.</t>

            <t>If the "VoiceActivityDetection" option is
            specified, with a value of "true", the offer MUST indicate support
            for silence suppression in the audio it receives by including
            comfort noise ("CN") codecs for each offered audio codec,
            as specified in
            <xref target="RFC3389"></xref>, Section 5.1, except for
            codecs that have their own internal silence suppression
            support. For codecs that have their own internal silence
            suppression support, the appropriate fmtp parameters for
            that codec MUST be specified to indicate that silence
            suppression for received audio is desired. For example,
            when using the Opus codec
            <xref target="RFC6716" />, the "usedtx=1" parameter,
            specified in
            <xref target="RFC7587" />, would be used in the offer.</t>

            <t>If the "VoiceActivityDetection" option is specified,
            with a value of "false", the JSEP implementation MUST NOT
            emit "CN" codecs. For codecs that have their own internal
            silence suppression support, the appropriate fmtp
            parameters for that codec MUST be specified to indicate
            that silence suppression for received audio is not desired.
            For example, when using the Opus codec, the "usedtx=0"
            parameter would be specified in the offer. In addition,
            the implementation MUST NOT use silence suppression for
            media it generates, regardless of whether the "CN"
            codecs or related fmtp parameters appear in the peer's
            description. The impact of these rules is that silence
            suppression in JSEP depends on mutual agreement of both sides,
            which ensures consistent handling regardless of which codec is used.
            </t>

      <section title="Generating an Answer"
      anchor="sec.generating-an-answer">

        <t>When createAnswer is called, a new SDP description must be
        created that is compatible with the supplied remote description
        as well as the requirements specified in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage"></xref>. The exact
        details of this process are explained below.</t>
        <section title="Initial Answers" anchor="sec.initial-answers">

          <t>When createAnswer is called for the first time after a
          remote description has been provided, the result is known as
          the initial answer. If no remote description has been
          installed, an answer cannot be generated, and an error MUST
          be returned.</t>

          <t>Note that the remote description SDP may not have been
          created by a JSEP endpoint and may not conform to all the
          requirements listed in
          <xref target="sec-create-offer"></xref>. For many cases, this
          is not a problem. However, if any mandatory SDP attributes
          are missing, or functionality listed as mandatory-to-use
          above is not present, this MUST be treated as an error, and
          MUST cause the affected m= sections to be marked as
          rejected.</t>

          <t>The first step in generating an initial answer is to
          generate session-level attributes. The process here is
          identical to that indicated in the initial offers section
          above, except that the "a=ice-options" line, with the
          "trickle" option as specified in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-ice-trickle"></xref>, Section 4, is
          only included if such an option was present in the offer.</t>

          <t>The next step is to generate session-level lip sync
          groups, as defined in
          <xref target="RFC5888" />, Section 7. For each group of type
          "LS" present in the offer, select the local RtpTransceivers
          that are referenced by the MID values in the specified group,
          and determine which of them either reference a common local
          MediaStream (specified in the calls to
          addTrack/addTransceiver used to create them), or have no
          MediaStream to reference because they were not created by
          addTrack/addTransceiver. If at least two such RtpTransceivers
          exist, a group of type "LS" with the mid values of these
          RtpTransceivers MUST be added. Otherwise the offered "LS"
          group MUST be ignored and no corresponding group generated in
          the answer.</t>

          <t>As a simple example, consider the following offer of a
          single audio and single video track contained in the same
          MediaStream. SDP lines not relevant to this example have been
          removed for clarity. As explained in
          <xref target="sec-create-offer" />, a group of type "LS" has
          been added that references each track's RtpTransceiver.</t>

          <t>If the answerer uses a single MediaStream when it adds its
          tracks, both of its transceivers will reference this stream,
          and so the subsequent answer will contain a "LS" group
          identical to that in the offer, as shown below:</t>

          <t>

          </t>

          <t>However, if the answerer groups its tracks into separate
          MediaStreams, its transceivers will reference different
          streams, and so the subsequent answer will not contain a "LS"
          group.</t>

          <t>Finally, if the answerer does not add any tracks, its
          transceivers will not reference any MediaStreams, causing the
          preferences of the offerer to be maintained, and so the
          subsequent answer will contain an identical "LS" group.</t>

          <t>The
          <xref target="sec.detailed-example" /> example later in this
          document shows a more involved case of "LS" group
          generation.</t>

          <t>The next step is to generate m= sections for each m=
          section that is present in the remote offer, as specified in
          <xref target="RFC3264"></xref>, Section 6. For the purposes
          of this discussion, any session-level attributes in the offer
          that are also valid as media-level attributes are considered
          to be present in each m= section.</t>

          <t>The next step is to go through each offered m= section.
          Each offered m= section will have an associated
          RtpTransceiver, as described in
          <xref target="sec.applying-a-remote-desc" />. If there are
          more RtpTransceivers than there are m= sections, the
          unmatched RtpTransceivers will need to be associated in a
          subsequent offer.</t>

          <t>For each offered m= section, if any of the following
          conditions are true, the corresponding m= section in the
          answer MUST be marked as rejected by setting the port in the
          m= line to zero, as indicated in
          <xref target="RFC3264"></xref>, Section 6, and further
          processing for this m= section can be skipped:
          <list style="symbols">

            <t>The associated RtpTransceiver has been stopped.</t>

            <t>None of the offered media formats are supported and, if

            <t>The bundle policy is "max-bundle", and this is not the
            first m= section or in the same bundle group as the first
            m= section.</t>

            <t>The bundle policy is "balanced", and this is not the

            group as the first m= section for this media type.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>Otherwise, each m= section in the answer should then be
          generated as specified in
          <xref target="RFC3264"></xref>, Section 6.1. For the m= line
          itself, the following rules must be followed:
          <list style="symbols">

            <t>The port value would normally be set to the port of the
            default ICE candidate for this m= section, but given that
            no candidates are available yet, the "dummy" port value of
            9 (Discard) MUST be used, as indicated in
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-ice-trickle"></xref>, Section
            5.1.</t>

            <t>The &lt;proto&gt; field MUST be set to exactly match the
            &lt;proto&gt; field for the corresponding m= line in the
            offer.</t>

            <t>If codec preferences have been set for the associated
            transceiver, media formats MUST be generated in the
            corresponding order, regardless of what was offered,
            and MUST exclude any codecs not present in the codec
            preferences.</t>

            <t>Otherwise, the media formats on the m= line
            MUST be generated in the same order as those offered in the
            current remote description, excluding any currently unsupported
            formats. Any currently available media formats that are
            not present in the current remote description MUST be added after
            all existing formats.</t>

            <t>In either case, the media formats in the answer MUST include
            at least one format that is present in the offer, but MAY include
            formats that are locally supported but not present in the offer,
            as mentioned in <xref target="RFC3264" />, Section 6.1. If no
            common format exists, the m= section is rejected as described
            above.
            </t>
          </list></t>

          <t>The m= line MUST be followed immediately by a "c=" line,
          as specified in
          <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 5.7. Again, as no
          candidates are available yet, the "c=" line must contain the
          "dummy" value "IN IP4 0.0.0.0", as defined in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-ice-trickle"></xref>, Section 5.1.</t>

          <t>If the offer supports bundle, all m= sections to be
          bundled must use the same ICE credentials and candidates; all
          m= sections not being bundled must use unique ICE credentials
          and candidates. Each m= section MUST contain the following
          attributes (which are of attribute types other than IDENTICAL
          and TRANSPORT):
          <list style="symbols">

            <t>If and only if present in the offer, an "a=mid" line, as
            specified in
            <xref target="RFC5888"></xref>, Section 9.1. The "mid"
            value MUST match that specified in the offer.</t>

            <t>A direction attribute, determined by applying the rules
            regarding the offered direction specified in

            intersecting with the direction of the associated
            RtpTransceiver. For example, in the case where an m=
            section is offered as "sendonly", and the local transceiver
            is set to "sendrecv", the result in the answer is a
            "recvonly" direction.</t>

            <t>For each media format on the m= line, "a=rtpmap" and
            "a=fmtp" lines, as specified in
            <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 6, and
            <xref target="RFC3264"></xref>, Section 6.1.</t>

            <t>If "rtx" is present in the offer, for each primary codec
            where RTP retransmission should be used, a corresponding

            primary codec and an "a=fmtp" line that references the
            payload type of the primary codec, as specified in
            <xref target="RFC4588"></xref>, Section 8.1.</t>

            <t>For each supported FEC mechanism, "a=rtpmap" and

            <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>, Section 6. The FEC
            mechanisms that MUST be supported are specified in
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-fec"></xref>, Section 6, and
            specific usage for each media type is outlined in Sections
            4 and 5.</t>

            <t>If this m= section is for media with configurable
            durations of media per packet, e.g., audio, an "a=maxptime"

            an answerer will not try to use silence suppression with any

        <t>Note that the application MAY modify the SDP to reduce the

        (post-setLocalDescription) or the offer that it installs from
        the far side (pre-setRemoteDescription), as long as it remains
        a valid SDP offer and specifies a subset of what was in the
        original offer. This is safe because the answer is not
        permitted to expand capabilities, and therefore will just
        respond to what is present in the offer.</t>

        <t>The application SHOULD NOT modify the SDP in the answer it
        transmits, as the answer contains the negotiated capabilities,

            the unit from kbps to bps (as required by TIAS), and the
            0.95 is to allocate 5% to RTCP. "TIAS" is used in

          <t>If the remote DTLS fingerprint has been changed or the
          tls-id has changed, tear down the DTLS connection. This
          includes the case when the PeerConnection state is

          down but the answer does not indicate an ICE restart or, in
          the case of "have-remote-pranswer", new ICE credentials, an
          error MUST be generated. If an ICE restart is performed
          without a change in tls-id or fingerprint, then the same
          DTLS connection is continued over the new ICE channel.</t>

          <t>If no valid DTLS connection exists, prepare to start a
          DTLS connection, using the specified roles and fingerprints,
          on any underlying ICE components, once they are active.</t>

          <t>If the m= section proto value indicates use of RTP:

            <t>If the m= section has RTCP mux enabled, discard the RTCP

            transport layers have been established.
            If an SSRC has not already been
            chosen for this outgoing RTP stream, choose a random one.
            If media is already being transmitted, the same SSRC SHOULD
            be used unless the clockrate of the new codec is different,
            in which case a new SSRC MUST be chosen, as specified in

            <t>The payload type mapping from the remote description is

            <t>Enable the RTCP feedback mechanisms referenced in the

        <t>This section shows a very simple example that sets up a
        minimal audio / video call between two JSEP endpoints without
        using trickle ICE. The example in the following section
        provides a more detailed example of what could happen in a JSEP
        session.</t>

        <t>The code flow below shows Alice's endpoint initiating the
        session to Bob's endpoint. The messages from the JavaScript
        application in Alice's browser to the JavaScript in Bob's
        browser, abbreviated as AliceJS and BobJS respectively,
        are assumed to flow over some signaling protocol via a
        web server. The JavaScript on both Alice's side and Bob's side waits
        for all candidates before sending the offer or answer, so the
        offers and answers are complete; trickle ICE is not used. The
        user agents (JSEP implementations) in Alice and Bob's browsers, abbreviated as AliceUA
        and BobUA respectively, are using the default bundle policy of
        "balanced", and the default RTCP mux policy of "require".</t>

        <t>This section shows a more involved example of a session
        between two JSEP endpoints. Trickle ICE is used in full trickle
        mode, with a bundle policy of "max-bundle", an RTCP mux policy
        of "require", and a single TURN server. Initially, both Alice
        and Bob establish an audio channel and a data channel. Later,
        Bob adds two video flows, one for his video feed, and one for
        screensharing, both supporting FEC, and with the video feed
        configured for simulcast. Alice accepts these video flows, but
        does not add video flows of her own, so they are handled as
        recvonly. Alice also specifies a maximum video decoder
        resolution.</t>

      <section title="Early Transport Warmup Example"
      anchor="sec.warmup-example">

        <t>This example demonstrates the early warmup technique
        described in
        <xref target="sec.use-of-provisional-answer" />. Here, Alice's
        endpoint sends an offer to Bob's endpoint to start an
        audio/video call. Bob immediately responds with an answer that
        accepts the audio/video m= sections, but marks them as sendonly
        (from his perspective), meaning that Alice will not yet send
        media. This allows the JSEP implementation to start negotiating
        ICE and DTLS immediately. Bob's endpoint then prompts him to
        answer the call, and when he does, his endpoint sends a second
        offer which enables the audio and video m= sections, and
        thereby bidirectional media transmission. The advantage of such
        a flow is that as soon as the first answer is received, the
        implementation can proceed with ICE and DTLS negotiation and
        establish the session transport. If the transport setup
        completes before the second offer is sent, then media can be
        transmitted immediately by the callee immediately upon
        answering the call, minimizing perceived post-dial-delay. The
        second offer/answer exchange can also change the preferred
        codecs or other session parameters.</t>

        <t>This example also makes use of the "relay" ICE candidate
        policy described in
        <xref target="sec.ice-candidate-policy" /> to minimize the ICE
        gathering and checking needed.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations"
    anchor="sec.security-considerations">

      <t>The IETF has published separate documents
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch" />
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security" /> describing the security
      architecture for WebRTC as a whole. The remainder of this section
      describes security considerations for this document.</t>

      <t>While formally the JSEP interface is an API, it is better to
      think of it is an Internet protocol, with the JS being
      untrustworthy from the perspective of the endpoint. Thus, the
      threat model of
      <xref target="RFC3552" /> applies. In particular, JS can call the
      API in any order and with any inputs, including malicious ones.
      This is particularly relevant when we consider the SDP which is
      passed to setLocalDescription(). While correct API usage requires
      that the application pass in SDP which was derived from
      createOffer() or createAnswer(), there is no guarantee that
      applications do so. The JSEP implementation MUST be prepared for
      the JS to pass in bogus data instead.</t>

      <t>Conversely, the application programmer MUST recognize that the
      JS does not have complete control of endpoint behavior. One case
      that bears particular mention is that editing ICE candidates out
      of the SDP or suppressing trickled candidates does not have the
      expected behavior: implementations will still perform checks from
      those candidates even if they are not sent to the other side.
      Thus, for instance, it is not possible to prevent the remote peer
      from learning your public IP address by removing server reflexive
      candidates. Applications which wish to conceal their public IP
      address should instead configure the ICE agent to use only relay
      candidates.</t>
